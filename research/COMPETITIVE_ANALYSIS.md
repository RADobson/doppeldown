# DoppelDown Competitive Analysis
*Brand Protection & Anti-Phishing SaaS Market*
*Prepared: 2026-02-02*

---

## Executive Summary

The brand protection / anti-phishing SaaS market is dominated by enterprise players charging $30K–$300K+/year with opaque, sales-driven pricing. Nearly every competitor requires "Request a Demo" or "Contact Sales" to get pricing. This creates a massive gap for a **self-serve, transparent-pricing product** that targets SMBs and mid-market companies who can't afford (or don't need) a full enterprise solution.

DoppelDown's current pricing ($49–$249/mo) positions it as the **only transparent, self-serve option** in a market full of enterprise gatekeeping. This is the single biggest positioning opportunity.

**Website:** redpoints.com
**Founded:** 2011 | **HQ:** Barcelona, Spain

**Target Market:** Consumer brands, D2C, retail, fashion, electronics. 1,300+ brand customers. Customers include Burton, FILA, Topcon.

**Strengths:** Most mature platform in the space. 10-year trained AI. Unlimited takedowns with no caps. Revenue recovery is a unique value prop. Excellent marketplace coverage. Platform partner integrations (Amazon, etc.).

**Weaknesses:** Counterfeits/marketplace focused — less emphasis on pure phishing/cybersecurity. Expensive. Long sales cycle. Overkill for small brands.

**DoppelDown Opportunity:** Red Points is a Ferrari when many brands need a reliable sedan. DoppelDown can serve brands who need phishing + impersonation detection without the counterfeit/marketplace complexity (or cost). Also: Red Points has no self-serve tier.

---

### 3. Bolster.ai (Bolster)
**Website:** bolster.ai
**Founded:** 2020 | **HQ:** Santa Clara, CA
**Funding:** ~$24M (Series A)

**Pricing:** Not public. Enterprise sales only. Estimated $40K–$200K+/year.

**Key Features:**
- AI-powered phishing detection (LLM + computer vision)
- Automated takedowns
- Brand impersonation monitoring
- Dark web monitoring
- Typosquat detection
- Real-time dashboard
- API-first architecture
- Integrates with SIEM/SOAR
- Focuses heavily on AI/ML detection accuracy

**Target Market:** Enterprise, financial services, tech companies, large e-commerce.

**Strengths:** Strong AI/ML technology. API-first approach appeals to engineering teams. Good at detecting novel phishing that traditional signature-based tools miss.

**Weaknesses:** Cloudflare-protected site (couldn't even fetch their homepage — ironic for a security company). Smaller customer base. No self-serve. No transparent pricing. Less established brand.

**DoppelDown Opportunity:** Bolster is AI-first but enterprise-only. DoppelDown can offer similar AI-powered detection at SMB-friendly pricing. Their API-first approach is worth emulating.

---

### 4. PhishLabs (Fortra)
**Website:** phishlabs.com (now part of fortra.com)
**Founded:** 2008 | **Acquired by Fortra (formerly HelpSystems) in 2021**
**Parent Company Funding:** Fortra is a $2B+ private equity-backed firm (Thoma Bravo)

**Pricing:** Not public. Enterprise only. Estimated $50K–$250K+/year as part of Fortra's broader security portfolio.

**Key Features:**
- Digital Risk Protection (DRP)
- Anti-phishing (email, SMS, voice)
- Brand impersonation detection
- Domain monitoring and takedowns
- Social media threat intelligence
- Dark web monitoring
- Credential monitoring
- Mobile app monitoring
- Managed SOC services
- Integrates into Fortra's broader security suite (data security, pen testing, etc.)

**Target Market:** Large enterprise, financial services, healthcare. Part of Fortra's broader security platform sale.

**Strengths:** Deep threat intelligence. Part of massive security portfolio (upsell potential for Fortra). Strong managed services / SOC. Long track record since 2008. Trusted by large banks.

**Weaknesses:** Lost independent identity inside Fortra. Bloated enterprise sales process. No longer a nimble startup — it's a cog in a PE-backed machine. No self-serve. Pricing requires navigating Fortra's broader sales motion.

**DoppelDown Opportunity:** PhishLabs was the "independent" brand protection tool, but got swallowed by Fortra. There's a gap for a modern, independent tool that isn't trying to upsell you into a $2B security conglomerate. Many mid-market CISOs who used to like PhishLabs may be looking for alternatives.

### 5. Allure Security
**Website:** alluresecurity.com
**Founded:** 2017 | **HQ:** Watertown, CT
**Funding:** ~$12M

**Pricing:** Not public. Demo-based sales. Estimated $30K–$100K+/year.

**Key Features:**
- **Scam Defense Platform™** — detect, defuse, destroy methodology
- **Preemptive Scam Detection™** — finds threats before they go live
- **Patented deception technology** — injects fake credentials into phishing sites, poisons attacker data
- Expert-led managed response team (U.S. Special Forces veterans)
- "Takedown Blitz" methodology — simultaneous engagement of all entities
- **Definitive Global Takedowns™** — dismantles infrastructure, not just content
- Honeypot credential injection
- Dark web monitoring for stolen creds
- Typosquat-agnostic coverage (content-based, not just URL matching)
- Cloaking bypass (Cloudflare Turnstile, etc.)
- Coverage: websites, mobile apps, social media, digital ads, dark web

**Target Market:** Banking, financial services, insurance, real estate, consumer goods. Top-rated on Gartner Peer Insights for brand protection. Strong banking focus.

**Strengths:** Genuinely differentiated with patented deception tech (injecting fake creds into phishing sites is brilliant). Preemptive detection before scams go live. Military-grade response team. Strong Gartner ratings.

**Weaknesses:** Small team, limited scale. Banking-heavy — less proven in other verticals. Not self-serve. Deception tech is innovative but hard to explain to non-technical buyers.

**DoppelDown Opportunity:** Allure's deception tech is genuinely innovative, but it's locked behind enterprise sales. The concept of "fighting back" against phishers (not just taking down) is compelling. DoppelDown could incorporate lightweight deception features (honeypot tracking, fake credential injection) as a premium differentiator — at a fraction of the cost.

### 6. ZeroFox
**Website:** zerofox.com
**Founded:** 2013 | **HQ:** Baltimore, MD
**Funding:** $150M+ (went public via SPAC in 2022, later taken private by Haveli Investments in 2024)

**Pricing:** Bundle-based (public structure, prices not listed):
- **Foundation Bundle:** 2 brand protections, 10 domain protections, 250 takedowns/yr
- **Core Bundle:** 5 brands, 50 domains, 10 executives, 500 takedowns/yr, intelligence search
- **Premium Bundle:** 50 brands, 100 domains, 100 executives, 1,000 takedowns/yr, managed service
- **Executive Bundle:** Executive-focused protection with dedicated threat assessments
- Estimated $30K–$200K+/year depending on bundle

**Key Features:**
- Unified external cybersecurity platform
- Brand & domain protection
- Executive & VIP protection (anti-doxxing, deepfake detection)
- Dark web & data leakage monitoring
- Social media monitoring (180+ platforms)
- External attack surface management
- Intelligence search (surface, deep, dark web)
- Dark web operatives (human HUMINT)
- Dedicated analysts available
- Domain takedowns
- PII removal from data brokers
- 1M+ threats disrupted annually via 80+ partners
- AI deepfake detection
- SIEM/SOAR integrations

**Target Market:** Enterprise, large mid-market. Financial services, healthcare, tech, retail, government.

**Strengths:** Broadest platform — goes beyond brand protection into full external cybersecurity. Executive protection is unique. Human intelligence operatives in dark web. Massive scale (1M+ threats/year). Published bundle structure gives some pricing transparency (though still "contact us" for actual numbers).

**Weaknesses:** Turbulent corporate history (SPAC, taken private). Brand protection is one feature among many — not their sole focus. Complex pricing. Overkill for a company that just needs domain monitoring. Enterprise-heavy.

**DoppelDown Opportunity:** ZeroFox tries to be everything for everyone. DoppelDown can be laser-focused on brand impersonation and phishing — doing one thing excellently at 1/10th the price. ZeroFox's executive protection concept could be a DoppelDown add-on (monitor for CEO impersonation scams).

### 7. Memcyco
**Website:** memcyco.com
**Founded:** 2021 | **HQ:** Tel Aviv, Israel
**Funding:** $37M Series A (announced recently)

**Pricing:** Not public. Sales-driven.

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time digital impersonation protection** (unique: protects during the attack, not just after)
- Account takeover (ATO) prevention
- Credit card data theft protection
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack detection
- Credential stuffing protection
- SEO poisoning detection
- AI-powered prediction of ATOs before they happen
- Detects phishing sites not yet in threat databases
- Individual victim-level impact analysis
- Serves security teams, fraud/risk teams, and digital business teams

**Target Market:** Financial services, e-commerce, any business with high-value customer accounts. Newer company focused on innovative real-time approach.

**Strengths:** Genuinely novel approach — protects customers in real-time during active attacks, not just detection + takedown after the fact. Strong award recognition (Fast Company, Cybersecurity Excellence Awards, Global InfoSec). Fresh $37M funding gives runway. ATO prevention is a hot, growing market.

**Weaknesses:** Very new (2021). Limited public information on features/pricing. Narrow focus on real-time ATO — doesn't cover counterfeit, marketplace, or broader brand abuse. Not proven at scale yet.

**DoppelDown Opportunity:** Memcyco's "real-time protection during attack" concept is interesting but niche. DoppelDown could incorporate a lightweight real-time alert system (e.g., notify the brand owner's customers when a phishing site is detected) as a differentiation feature, without the complexity of Memcyco's full approach.

---

### 8. Netcraft
**Website:** netcraft.com
**Founded:** 1995 | **HQ:** London, UK (with US and AU offices)

**Pricing:** Not public. Enterprise sales. Has a "Pricing" link in nav but it leads to a 404 / contact page. Estimated $25K–$150K+/year.

**Key Features:**
- Phishing detection and takedown (claims to take down 33% of all phishing sites globally)
- Domain protection
- Social media protection
- Mobile app protection
- Deep & dark web monitoring
- Phone scam disruption (novel — disables phone-based scams)
- Threat intelligence feeds
- Phishing kit analysis
- Scam intelligence
- DMARC visualization
- Marked account injection
- Screenshot tool with 250+ proxy network (view attacker content across geos)
- 23B datapoints/year processed
- 80K+ human-written detection rules + AI/ML
- End-to-end automation
- Market-leading takedown times (established trust with registrars/hosts over 20+ years)

**Target Market:** Financial services, internet infrastructure, retail/e-commerce, media, tech, healthcare, public sector, transit.

**Strengths:** The OG of brand protection (since 1995!). Unmatched reputation with registrars/hosting providers for fast takedowns. Massive dataset. Phone scam disruption is unique. Global presence. Trusted by the world's biggest banks.

**Weaknesses:** Legacy brand — perceived as "old school" despite modern tech. No self-serve. Enterprise sales cycle. Website doesn't clearly communicate modern AI capabilities.

**DoppelDown Opportunity:** Netcraft has the takedown relationships but is enterprise-only. DoppelDown can build fast takedown capabilities over time, but in the short term, the opportunity is to serve everyone Netcraft says "too small" to. Also, Netcraft's phone scam disruption and DMARC features are worth noting as potential future additions.

### 9. MarqVision (Bonus Competitor)
**Website:** marqvision.com
**Founded:** 2020 | **HQ:** Seoul, South Korea (with US office)
**Funding:** $20M+ (Series B)

**Pricing:** Not public. Sales-driven. Estimated $20K–$100K+/year.

**Key Features:**
- AI-powered counterfeit detection ("Marq AI")
- Brand Exposure Report with "Saturation Rate" metric
- Impersonation takedowns (claims 15-minute detection-to-enforcement)
- Gray market / unauthorized seller monitoring (94%+ SKU-matching accuracy)
- Anti-piracy protection
- Trademark registration service (with refund guarantee)
- Anti-counterfeiting litigation (China-based legal team)
- Physical raids in China (Shenzhen, Guangdong, Yiwu)
- 10M+ sellers tracked in global database
- 4.9-star G2 rating

**Target Market:** Consumer brands, D2C, fashion, beauty, gaming. Korean/Asian market strong. Customers include Miele, Lush, FILA, MSCHF.

**Strengths:** Very fast enforcement (15-min claim is industry-leading). Strong in Asian markets/marketplaces. Physical enforcement in China is unique. Revenue recovery via litigation. Modern UX (rare in this space).

**Weaknesses:** Counterfeit/marketplace focused — less phishing/cybersecurity. Asian market strength may not translate globally. No self-serve.

**DoppelDown Opportunity:** MarqVision's speed claims (15-min enforcement) and modern UX are a model for DoppelDown. The key lesson: customers want speed and a good product experience, not just detection.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| BrandShield | ❌ No | $30K–$100K+ | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Red Points | ❌ (Tier names only) | $15K–$150K+ | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Bolster.ai | ❌ No | $40K–$200K+ | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| PhishLabs (Fortra) | ❌ No | $50K–$250K+ | ❌ No | ❌ No |

| **DoppelDown** | **✅ Yes ($49–$249/mo)** | **$588–$2,988** | **✅ Yes** | **✅ Yes** |

**DoppelDown is literally 10x–100x cheaper than every competitor, and the only one with transparent pricing and self-serve onboarding.**

---

## Market Gap Analysis

### Gap 1: No Self-Serve Options Exist
Every single competitor requires "Contact Sales" or "Request a Demo." Not one offers a credit card signup with instant access. This is DoppelDown's #1 advantage.

### Gap 2: SMB Market Is Unserved
The entire market focuses on enterprise ($30K+/year minimum). There are millions of businesses with 10–500 employees who have brands worth protecting but can't justify a $50K/year contract. They're stuck with manual Google Alerts and hoping for the best.

### Gap 3: Transparent Pricing Is Non-Existent
Even Red Points and ZeroFox, which show tier *names*, don't show prices. Buyers hate this. DoppelDown showing $49/$99/$249 on the landing page is a massive trust signal.

### Gap 4: Speed to Value
Every competitor has multi-week onboarding, sales calls, and implementation. DoppelDown can offer "sign up and see your first scan results in 5 minutes."

### Gap 5: Focused Simplicity
Most competitors try to cover everything: counterfeits, piracy, gray market, social media, dark web, executive protection, physical raids. DoppelDown can win by doing one thing well: **detect and help take down domains/sites impersonating your brand.**

---

## DoppelDown Positioning Strategy

### The Positioning Statement
> **DoppelDown is brand protection for the rest of us.** Enterprise-grade AI detection at startup-friendly prices, with self-serve onboarding and transparent pricing. No sales calls, no six-figure contracts, no 30-day implementations.

### The Competitive Wedge
DoppelDown isn't trying to beat ZeroFox or Netcraft on feature depth. It's attacking from below — serving the 95% of businesses that can't afford $50K/year but desperately need brand protection.

Think: **Mailchimp vs. Salesforce Marketing Cloud**, or **Stripe vs. legacy payment processors.**

### Key Differentiators to Emphasize

1. **Transparent Pricing** — "$49/mo. Right there on the website. No sales call needed."
2. **Self-Serve Onboarding** — "Sign up with a credit card. See results in minutes."
3. **AI-First Detection** — "Same AI technology that powers the enterprise tools, at 1/100th the cost."
4. **Free Tier** — No competitor offers this. It's a powerful acquisition funnel.
5. **Developer-Friendly** — API access for teams that want to integrate (follow Bolster.ai's lead here).

### What DoppelDown Should NOT Try to Do (Yet)

- ❌ Physical counterfeit enforcement / raids
- ❌ Managed SOC / 24/7 human analysts
- ❌ Dark web operatives (human intelligence)
- ❌ Executive personal protection / PII removal
- ❌ Revenue recovery litigation
- ❌ 5,000+ marketplace monitoring

These are all enterprise features that require scale DoppelDown doesn't have yet. Focus on the core: **detect impersonation → alert → facilitate takedown.**

### Feature Roadmap Inspiration from Competitors

| Feature | Inspired By | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deception/honeypot tech | Allure Security | Medium | Huge differentiator if implemented |
| Real-time customer alerts | Memcyco | Medium | "Your customers get warned before they get scammed" |
| Takedown automation | Netcraft, MarqVision | High | Speed of takedown is the #1 metric customers care about |
| Executive impersonation monitoring | ZeroFox | Low | Good premium add-on later |
| AI Copilot / insights | Red Points | Medium | "Here's what we found and why it matters" |
| Revenue impact estimation | Red Points, MarqVision | Medium | "Estimated revenue at risk: $X" — justifies the subscription |
| Social media scanning | BrandShield, ZeroFox | High | Already started; expand coverage |
| DMARC reporting | Netcraft | Low | Nice-to-have for email-focused brands |

### Pricing Strategy Recommendations

Current tiers ($49/$99/$249) are well-positioned but could use refinement:

- **Free:** 1 domain, basic monitoring, weekly email digest — lead gen funnel
- **Starter ($49/mo):** 3 domains, daily scans, email alerts, basic reporting
- **Pro ($99/mo):** 10 domains, real-time alerts, takedown assistance templates, API access
- **Business ($249/mo):** 25 domains, priority scanning, assisted takedowns, dedicated Slack channel
- **Enterprise (Custom):** Eventually, for when larger customers show up — don't rush this

### Go-to-Market Priorities

1. **Content marketing:** "How much does brand protection cost?" — own this SEO keyword. Every buyer Googles it and finds nothing because competitors hide their pricing.
2. **Comparison pages:** "DoppelDown vs. BrandShield" (etc.) — capture frustrated enterprise shoppers.
3. **Free tier virality:** Let people scan their brand for free. When they see threats, they'll upgrade.
4. **SMB community presence:** Indie Hackers, HackerNews, Reddit r/startups, r/cybersecurity, ProductHunt launch.
5. **Partner with web hosting / domain registrars:** "When you buy a domain, protect your brand with DoppelDown." Bundling opportunity.

---

## Conclusion

The brand protection market is a $3B+ industry growing 15–20% annually, dominated by enterprise players with opaque pricing and lengthy sales cycles. DoppelDown has a genuine opportunity to be the **Stripe of brand protection** — making sophisticated technology accessible to everyone with transparent pricing and instant onboarding.

The biggest risk isn't the technology (it's solid). It's awareness. Nobody knows DoppelDown exists yet. The go-to-market strategy matters more than adding features right now.

**Bottom line:** Ship it, get it in front of people, and let the product speak. The market gap is real.
