## 1. Executive Summary

### The Channel Thesis

DoppelDown's direct-to-customer motion (content, SEO, PLG) will drive early revenue. But **channel partnerships are the fastest path to $50K+ MRR** because:

1. **One MSP partner = 20-50 potential customers** under a single relationship
2. **Partners sell trust** — their clients already trust them, so DoppelDown doesn't need to earn it from scratch
3. **Partners cover ground Richard can't** — geographic reach, industry verticals, language/culture barriers
4. **Channel revenue compounds** — each new partner's clients generate ongoing MRR with near-zero incremental acquisition cost
5. **Richard's cybersecurity network is the distribution advantage** — no other brand-protection startup has a founder embedded in the MSP/MSSP ecosystem

### The Structural Opportunity

Every enterprise brand protection vendor (BrandShield, ZeroFox, Netcraft, Red Points) has a channel strategy — but it's **enterprise-to-enterprise**: expensive, complex, long sales cycles. None of them serve the SMB channel:

```
ENTERPRISE VENDOR CHANNEL MODEL                DOPPELDOWN CHANNEL MODEL
┌───────────────────────────┐                  ┌───────────────────────────┐
│ $50K+/yr per client       │                  │ $79-$499/mo per client    │
│ 6-month sales cycle       │                  │ Same-day onboarding       │
│ Named account managers    │                  │ Self-serve partner portal │
│ Complex contract neg.     │                  │ Simple partner agreement  │
│ Min. 100 client brands    │                  │ Start with 1 brand        │
│ Enterprise MSAs required  │                  │ Month-to-month            │
│ Result: <20 partner deals │                  │ Result: 100s of partners  │
│ per year globally         │                  │ across the SMB ecosystem  │
└───────────────────────────┘                  └───────────────────────────┘
```

**DoppelDown can build a channel program that enterprise vendors structurally cannot match in the SMB segment.**

### Target Outcomes

| Milestone | Timeline | Partners | Partner-Sourced MRR | % of Total MRR |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| First partner revenue | Month 2-3 | 2-3 | $500 | 25% |
| Channel traction | Month 6 | 8-10 | $3,000 | 35% |
| Channel engine | Month 12 | 20-25 | $12,000 | 40% |
| Channel at scale | Month 24 | 50+ | $35,000+ | 45% |

---

## 2. Strategic Rationale — Why Channels Win

### The Partner Math vs. Direct Sales Math

**Direct acquisition (Richard doing outbound):**
```
Richard's available selling time: 30 min/day = ~10 hrs/month
Contacts per month: 40-60 (cold email + LinkedIn)
Response rate: 8-15%
Demo-to-close: 25-35%
Customers per month: 1-3

Capacity ceiling: ~36 customers/year (Richard's time is the bottleneck)
```

**Channel acquisition (partners selling for DoppelDown):**
```
Partners onboarded per quarter: 5-8
Each partner has: 30-100 existing clients
Adoption rate per partner: 15-30% of client base
New customers per partner per year: 5-30

With 20 partners: 100-600 customers/year (no Richard time constraint)
```

**Channel partners break the founder-time bottleneck.** Every hour Richard spends enabling a partner multiplies into dozens of customer conversations Richard never needs to have.

### Why Partners Will Say Yes

Partners aren't doing DoppelDown a favour — they're solving their own problems:

| Partner Type | Their Problem | How DoppelDown Solves It |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **MSPs** | Commodity race to the bottom; need to differentiate | New service line = higher ARPU + stickier clients |
| **Digital Agencies** | Clients ask about brand protection; agency can't deliver | Add-on service with zero delivery overhead |
| **Cyber Resellers** | Portfolio gaps in brand protection; enterprise tools too expensive for SMB clients | Affordable tool they can actually sell to their SMB base |
| **Web Designers** | Limited recurring revenue; projects are one-time | Post-launch monitoring = ongoing recurring revenue |
| **Accountants/Advisors** | Clients getting scammed; advisor looks negligent if they don't help | Risk mitigation referral = client trust |

### Competitive Channel Landscape

| Competitor | Has Partner Program? | SMB Channel? | Self-Serve Partners? | Partner Margin |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| ZeroFox | Yes | No (enterprise only) | No | ~25-30% |
| BrandShield | Yes | No | No | ~20-25% |
| Red Points | Limited | No | No | Unknown |
| Netcraft | Technology partnerships | No | No | N/A |
| Bolster/CheckPhish | Emerging | No | No | Unknown |
| **DoppelDown** | **Building** | **Yes — only one** | **Yes** | **20-40%** |

**Nobody has an SMB channel program.** DoppelDown's partner program will be the only one that lets an MSP or agency add brand protection for their small business clients without a $50K minimum commitment.

## 4. Tier 1: MSP & MSSP Partners

### Why MSPs Are Priority #1

MSPs are DoppelDown's single most important channel for five reasons:

1. **Volume:** A single MSP manages 30-200+ client businesses. Selling to one MSP = selling to dozens of end clients.
2. **Trust:** MSP clients already trust their provider for security recommendations. DoppelDown doesn't need to earn that trust — the MSP transfers it.
3. **Stickiness:** MSP-managed clients churn at 1/3 the rate of direct customers because switching MSPs is painful, and brand protection is bundled into the managed service.
4. **Richard's access:** Richard works in cybersecurity presales. He knows MSPs. He attends MSP events. He speaks their language. This is the shortest path to revenue.
5. **LTV multiplication:** MSP accounts grow over time as the MSP adds more client brands. A single MSP account can grow from $200/mo to $2,000+/mo.

### MSP Value Proposition

**The pitch (in their language):**

> "Your clients are getting impersonated online, and you have nothing in your stack to address it. Enterprise brand protection tools cost $50K/year — way too expensive for your SMB clients.
>
> DoppelDown lets you add brand protection to your managed services for $63-$399/client/month at partner pricing. Sell it for $150-$500/month. Zero new headcount. AI does the scanning. You deliver the reports and look like a hero.
>
> Your clients get enterprise-grade protection. You get a new revenue line with 40-60% margins. We handle the technology. You own the relationship."

### MSP Partner Program — Detailed Structure

#### Partner Levels

| Level | Requirements | Discount | Benefits |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Registered** | Sign partner agreement | 20% off list | Partner portal access, marketing materials, email support |
| **Silver** | ≥5 client brands under management | 25% off list | + Quarterly business review, co-branded reports, priority support |
| **Gold** | ≥20 client brands under management | 30% off list | + Dedicated partner manager, lead sharing, event invitations, beta access |
| **Platinum** | ≥50 client brands under management, NFR licenses | 35% off list + volume bonuses | + White-label option, custom integrations, revenue share on referrals |

#### NFR (Not-for-Resale) Licenses

Every registered partner receives **2 free NFR licences** (Business tier) to:
- Monitor their own MSP brand (eat-your-own-dog-food)
- Use as a demo/evaluation environment for prospect pitches

This is critical — if the partner doesn't use the product themselves, they won't sell it convincingly.

The MSP doesn't sell "DoppelDown." They sell **brand protection as a managed service.** DoppelDown is the technology platform powering the service.

**MSP-to-Client Sales Conversation:**

```
MSP: "We've added a new service to our security stack — brand protection 
monitoring. It uses AI to scan for fake domains, phishing sites, and social 
media impersonation targeting your brand.

We ran a quick scan on your company as a demo — and we actually found 
[X] suspicious domains registered that look like yours.

[Shows report/dashboard]

For $150/month, we'll monitor your brand 24/7, alert you to new threats, 
and provide takedown-ready evidence packages when we find something serious. 
It's included in our premium security bundle, or available as a standalone 
add-on.

Want us to set it up?"
```

**Why this works for the MSP:**
- They're the hero who found threats the client didn't know about
- The "we found something" approach creates immediate urgency
- Clients rarely push back on $150/mo for brand protection when shown real threats
- It deepens the security relationship, making the MSP harder to replace

#### MSP Integration with Existing Workflows

| MSP Workflow | DoppelDown Touchpoint |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Quarterly Business Review (QBR)** | Include "Brand Protection Report" section showing threats detected, actions taken, risk posture trend |
| **Security Stack Review** | Position brand protection alongside endpoint, email, and network security |
| **Client Onboarding** | Add domain + social accounts to DoppelDown as part of onboarding checklist |
| **Incident Response** | Use DoppelDown evidence packages in IR reports and takedown requests |
| **Monthly Reporting** | Auto-include DoppelDown scan summary in managed services report |
| **Contract Renewals** | Use brand protection metrics to demonstrate value during renewal conversations |

## 5. Tier 2: Digital Agencies & Brand Consultancies

### Why Agencies Matter

Digital agencies and brand consultancies sit at the intersection of brand awareness and brand protection. They spend months building a client's brand — then watch helplessly as impersonators exploit it. DoppelDown gives them a tool to **protect the asset they built.**

### Agency Value Proposition

**The pitch (in their language):**

> "You spend months building your client's brand. Are you also protecting it?
>
> Brand impersonation is up 300% since 2024. Your clients' domains are being squatted, their social accounts cloned, and their customers phished — and most agencies have no answer when the client asks 'what are we doing about this?'
>
> DoppelDown lets you offer brand protection monitoring as a value-add service. No technical skills required. The AI does the scanning. You deliver professional reports with your branding. It's a $200+/client/month service line that deepens your client relationships and creates recurring revenue that doesn't depend on campaign performance."

### Agency Program Structure

| Element | Referral Track | Reseller Track |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **How it works** | Agency refers client → client signs up directly → agency earns commission | Agency purchases at partner price → resells to clients at list or markup |
| **Partner revenue** | 20% of referred client's first 12 months of payments | 20% discount off list price (resells at list or higher) |
| **Client relationship** | DoppelDown owns billing relationship | Agency owns billing relationship |
| **Co-branding** | DoppelDown branded with "Referred by [Agency]" | Co-branded reports (future: white-label) |
| **Minimum commitment** | None | 3 client brands minimum |
| **Best for** | Agencies who want passive income, don't want to manage the tool | Agencies who want full control, higher margins, deeper client lock-in |

### Agency Sales Enablement

**How the agency sells to their clients:**

| Client Scenario | Agency Pitch | DoppelDown Tier |

| Client's customer complained about a scam email | "We should scan your brand immediately — and set up ongoing protection." | Business ($199/mo) |
| High-profile client doing rebrand | "New brand launch = new impersonation risk. Brand protection from Day 1." | Business ($199/mo) |
| Client in regulated industry (finance, health) | "Regulators expect brand monitoring. Let's get you covered." | Enterprise ($499/mo) |
| Quarterly strategy review | "Here's your brand health report. We found 7 threats this quarter." | Any tier |

### Reseller Value Proposition

> "Your portfolio covers endpoints, email, and network. But what about brand risk?
>
> 60% of phishing attacks now involve brand impersonation — fake domains, cloned websites, social media impostors. Your clients are exposed, and you have nothing in your stack to address it.
>
> DoppelDown fills that gap. It's the only self-serve brand protection platform with transparent pricing your SMB and mid-market clients can actually afford. You buy at partner pricing, resell at list, and pocket 20-30% margin with zero delivery overhead.
>
> Add it to your security stack reviews. Include it in your QBRs. Bundle it with email security or endpoint deals. The cross-sell writes itself."

### Reseller Program Structure

| Level | Min. Annual Revenue | Discount | Deal Registration | Lead Sharing |
|-------|-------------------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Authorised** | $0 | 20% | 10% additional discount on registered deals | No |
| **Preferred** | $15K | 25% | 10% additional on registered | Inbound leads in territory |
| **Premier** | $50K | 30% | 15% additional on registered | Priority lead routing |

#### Deal Registration

Partners can register prospective deals for additional discount protection:

1. Partner submits deal registration via partner portal (company name, domain, contact, expected tier, timeline)
2. DoppelDown validates no existing direct relationship or competing registration
3. If approved, partner receives additional 10-15% discount for that specific deal
4. Registration valid for 90 days (renewable once)
5. If DoppelDown receives a direct inquiry from a registered prospect, the deal is routed to the partner

### vCISO / Security Consultant Sub-Segment

**Fractional CISOs and cybersecurity consultants** are a particularly high-value sub-segment within Tier 3:

| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Role** | Serve as outsourced CISO for 5-15 SMB/mid-market clients |
| **Authority** | High — they make or heavily influence security purchasing decisions |
| **Volume** | Lower per consultant, but extremely high close rate |
| **How to reach** | LinkedIn (they're prolific posters), AISA events, cybersecurity meetups |
| **Best approach** | "Give them the tool free for their own consultancy; they'll recommend it to every client" |

**vCISO Partner Offer:**
- Free Business-tier account for the consultancy
- 25% commission on every client they bring on board
- Co-authored "Brand Protection Risk Assessment" template they can use in client engagements
- Invitation to DoppelDown advisory board (ego + influence)

---

## 7. Tier 4: Technology & Integration Partners

### Strategy

Technology partnerships aren't about immediate revenue — they're about **embedded distribution.** When DoppelDown is listed in a marketplace or integrated into a workflow tool, it reaches buyers at the point of need without any sales effort.

### Priority Integration Partners

| Partner / Platform | Type | Strategic Value | Effort | Timeline |
|-------------------|------|----------------|--------|----------|
| **ConnectWise** (Marketplace) | MSP tool marketplace | Direct to MSP buyers at point of stack evaluation | Medium | Month 6-9 |
| **Datto/Kaseya** (Marketplace) | MSP tool marketplace | Same — massive MSP distribution | Medium | Month 6-9 |
| **Shopify** (App Store) | E-commerce platform | Access to 2M+ merchants (Michelle persona) | High | Month 9-12 |
| **Zapier** | Workflow automation | Connects DoppelDown to 6,000+ apps, appeals to technical buyers | Low | Month 4-6 |
| **Slack** (App Directory) | Communication | Threat alerts in channels where teams already work | Low | Month 4-6 |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Communication | Same as Slack, different buyer segment | Medium | Month 6-9 |
| **PagerDuty / Opsgenie** | Incident management | Critical threat alerts → incident workflows for security teams | Low | Month 6-9 |
| **HubSpot** (Marketplace) | CRM/Marketing | Brand protection tied to marketing operations | Medium | Month 9-12 |
| **WordPress** (Plugin) | Website platform | Self-serve brand monitoring for WordPress site owners | Medium | Month 9-12 |

### Integration Partner Engagement Model

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Build the integration (API/webhook) on DoppelDown's side first |
| 2 | Submit to partner marketplace with compelling listing (screenshots, description, reviews) |
| 3 | Write a blog post: "How to [Use Case] with DoppelDown + [Partner]" |
| 4 | Reach out to partner's partner manager / ecosystem team for co-marketing |
| 5 | Cross-promote: DoppelDown blog → partner marketplace, partner blog → DoppelDown |

### API-First Strategy

DoppelDown's API is the foundation for all technology partnerships. API availability at the Business tier ($199/mo) and above ensures that integration-oriented buyers have programmatic access:

```
API Use Cases for Partners:
├── MSP: Pull threat data into PSA/RMM dashboard
├── Agency: Auto-generate monthly client reports  
├── Reseller: Embed scan results in security assessments
├── SIEM: Forward alerts to security operations center
├── Custom: Build custom workflows and automations
└── White-label: Power partner-branded interfaces
```

---

## 8. Tier 5: Strategic & Distribution Partners

### Long-Term High-Impact Partnerships

These are 6-18 month partnerships that require relationship building but can transform DoppelDown's trajectory:

### 8.1 Domain Registrars & Hosting Providers

| Partner | Opportunity | Model | Effort |
|---------|------------|-------|--------|
| **VentraIP** (AU) | Bundle brand monitoring at domain purchase | Referral commission or white-label add-on | High |
| **Crazy Domains** (AU) | Same | Same | High |
| **Namecheap** | Global reach, developer-friendly brand | App marketplace listing or bundled add-on | High |
| **GoDaddy** | Massive SMB distribution (21M+ customers) | White-label integration or marketplace | Very High |
| **Cloudflare** | Security-adjacent, developer audience | Integration partnership + marketplace listing | Medium |

**The pitch to registrars:**

> "You sell domains. DoppelDown tells your customers when someone else registers a domain that looks like theirs. It's a natural post-purchase upsell — 'Protect the domain you just bought.' Offer it as a $10-$20/month add-on and split the revenue. Your customers get peace of mind. You get new recurring revenue from an existing customer base."

### 8.2 Insurance Companies (Cyber Insurance)

Cyber insurers want to **reduce claims.** Brand protection monitoring reduces phishing-related claims. There's a natural alignment:

| Opportunity | Model |
|------------|-------|
| Insurer recommends DoppelDown to policyholders | Referral commission (per signup) |
| DoppelDown monitoring as a policy discount trigger | "Customers with active brand monitoring get 5% premium discount" |
| Co-branded risk assessment | "Check if your brand is at risk — powered by [Insurer] + DoppelDown" |

**Timeline:** Month 12-18 (requires product maturity, case study data, and compliance documentation)

### 8.3 Industry Associations & Business Networks

| Association | Members | Partnership Opportunity |
|------------|---------|----------------------|
| **COSBOA** (Council of Small Business Organisations Australia) | 100K+ SMBs | Member benefit: free brand scan + discounted subscription |
| **AISA** (Australian Information Security Association) | Cybersecurity professionals | Speaker slots, vendor listings, member recommendations |
| **BNI / Chamber of Commerce** (Sunshine Coast) | Local businesses | Speaking engagements, referral partnerships with local members |
| **CompTIA** (ISAO program) | MSPs and IT companies | Channel partner program listing, educational content |
| **AustCyber** | Australian cybersecurity ecosystem | Ecosystem listing, co-marketing, government-adjacent credibility |

### 8.4 White-Label / OEM Partnerships

For select partners who want to offer brand protection under their own brand:

| Requirement | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Minimum commitment** | $2,000/month or 30+ client brands |
| **What partner gets** | Full white-label: their branding on UI, reports, and emails; custom domain (portal.partnerbrand.com) |
| **What DoppelDown provides** | All backend infrastructure, AI analysis, scanning, API, ongoing development |
| **Revenue model** | Partner pays wholesale (40-50% of retail equivalent); sets own retail price |
| **Support model** | Partner provides L1 support to their clients; DoppelDown provides L2/L3 |
| **Contract** | 12-month minimum commitment |

**Candidates for white-label:**
- Large MSPs who want to "own" the brand protection offering
- Cybersecurity distributors who want to offer it as part of a suite
- Domain registrars who want built-in monitoring
- Insurance companies who want policyholder monitoring tools

## 11. Partner Acquisition Playbook

### Phase 1: Warm Network (Month 1-3) — 5-10 Partners

Richard's professional network is the most valuable asset for seeding the partner program.

#### Target List Building

| Source | Expected Leads | Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Richard's LinkedIn connections (cybersecurity / MSP / IT) | 15-25 | 🔴 Highest |
| Former and current colleagues at Richard's employer | 5-10 | 🔴 Highest |
| Vendor contacts (CrowdStrike, Proofpoint, Netskope ecosystem) | 5-10 | 🟡 High |
| Local Sunshine Coast / QLD business contacts | 3-5 | 🟡 High |
| AISA / AustCyber network | 3-5 | 🟢 Medium |

#### Outreach Sequence (Warm Network)

**Step 1: LinkedIn/Phone — Personal Reach-Out**

> "Hey [Name], I've been building something on the side that I think is right in your wheelhouse.
>
> You know how every brand protection tool costs $50K+ a year and won't talk to SMBs? I built DoppelDown — AI-powered brand protection starting at $79/month, fully self-serve.
>
> I'm building a partner program for MSPs [/agencies/resellers] who want to add brand protection as a service line. Zero new headcount, 25-35% partner margin, and I handle all the tech.
>
> Want to have a look? I'll set you up with a free evaluation account — you can scan some of your client brands and see what turns up. Usually finds some interesting stuff."

**Step 2: Follow-up Email (if no response after 3 days)**

> Subject: Quick follow-up — brand protection for your clients
>
> Hey [Name],
>
> I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief. I ran a quick scan on [their client's domain or their own domain] through DoppelDown and found [X domain variations, Y active threats].
>
> [Optional screenshot of scan results]
>
> Thought this might be a useful conversation starter with your clients — and a potential new revenue line for you.
>
> Happy to jump on a 15-minute call or just give you a free evaluation account to poke around.
>
> Cheers,
> Richard

**Step 3: Demo Call (30 minutes)**

Agenda:
1. (5 min) Quick catch-up, context on DoppelDown
2. (10 min) Live scan of partner's own brand — show them threats
3. (5 min) Live scan of one of their clients — show them the opportunity
4. (5 min) Walk through partner economics (margin calculator)
5. (5 min) Next steps — set up evaluation account, agree on 30-day trial with 3-5 clients

### Phase 2: Cold Outreach (Month 3-6) — 10-20 Partners

Once the partner program is validated with warm network partners, scale with cold outreach.

#### Cold Outreach Channels

| Channel | Volume | Response Rate (Expected) | Conversion Rate |
|---------|--------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| LinkedIn connection request + message | 20/week | 15-25% | 5-10% (to demo) |
| Cold email (personalised, with scan results) | 30/week | 5-10% | 3-5% (to demo) |
| Reddit r/msp posts and comments | 1-2/week | N/A (community building) | Inbound interest |
| MSP community forums (ASCII, CompTIA) | 1-2/week | N/A | Inbound interest |
| LinkedIn content (Richard's posts about partnerships) | 3/week | N/A | Inbound interest |

#### Cold Email Template (MSP)

> Subject: Found 7 impersonation domains targeting [their client or their own domain]
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I ran your [client / MSP] domain through my AI brand protection scanner and found:
>
> • [variation1].com — active, hosting content
> • [variation2].net — MX records configured (possible email phishing)
> • [X] additional suspicious domain variations
>
> I'm Richard, founder of DoppelDown. We built the only SMB-priced brand protection platform — AI-powered, self-serve, starting at $79/month. Every competitor charges $50K+/year.
>
> I'm launching a partner program for MSPs. The opportunity:
> • Buy at 25% below list → resell at list or higher → 25%+ margin
> • New service line for your clients with zero delivery overhead
> • Multi-brand dashboard (manage all client brands in one view)
>
> Interested in a free evaluation account? I'll set you up with 5 brands for 90 days, no strings.
>
> Cheers,
> Richard
> Founder, DoppelDown
> [link to partner page]

### Phase 3: Scaled Acquisition (Month 6-12) — 20-50 Partners

| Strategy | Description | Expected Partners |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **MSP Event Sponsorship** | Sponsor local cybersecurity / MSP meetups (Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne) | 3-5 per event |
| **Webinar: "Adding Brand Protection to Your MSP Stack"** | LinkedIn Live / Zoom webinar targeting MSP owners | 5-10 registrations → 2-3 partners |
| **Partner Referral Program** | Existing partners refer other MSPs/agencies for $200 credit | 2-3 per quarter |
| **Channel Media** | Submit articles/interviews to ChannelE2E, CRN, ARN | Inbound interest |

## 12. Partner Portal & Multi-Tenant Management

### Partner Portal Requirements

The partner portal is the most critical product feature for channel success. Without it, partners can't efficiently manage multiple client brands — and they'll churn.

### MVP Partner Portal (Month 3-6)

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Multi-brand dashboard** | 🔴 Critical | Single view of all client brands — threat count, risk scores, scan status |
| **Client brand management** | 🔴 Critical | Add/remove client brands, assign tiers, manage scan settings |
| **Consolidated billing** | 🔴 Critical | Single invoice for all client brands (partner pays DoppelDown, invoices their clients separately) |
| **Partner-level reporting** | 🔴 Critical | Summary report across all client brands — exportable PDF |
| **Client-level reports** | 🔴 Critical | Individual client brand threat reports — downloadable, co-branded |
| **Partner profile** | 🟡 Important | Partner company info, logo upload (for co-branded reports), contact details |
| **User management** | 🟡 Important | Add team members with role-based access (admin, viewer, billing) |

### Full Partner Portal (Month 9-18)

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Client-facing read-only portal** | 🟡 Important | Give each client their own login to view their brand's threat dashboard |
| **White-label branding** | 🟡 Important | Partner's logo, colours, custom domain (portal.partnerco.com) |
| **Automated report delivery** | 🟡 Important | Monthly threat summary auto-emailed to each client |
| **Client onboarding wizard** | 🟢 Nice | Streamlined flow for partner to add a new client brand |
| **Revenue dashboard** | 🟢 Nice | Partner sees their total spend, margin, client breakdown |
| **API access** | 🟢 Nice | Programmatic management of client brands, pull data into PSA tools |
| **Slack/Teams notifications** | 🟢 Nice | New threat alerts in partner's team channel |
| **Deal registration** | 🟢 Nice | Submit and track deal registrations for additional discounts |

## 13. Channel Conflict Management

### Conflict Scenarios & Resolution Rules

Channel conflict is inevitable as both direct and partner sales grow. Clear rules prevent partner frustration and protect relationships.

| Scenario | Rule | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Partner and direct both pursuing same prospect** | Partner wins if deal is registered; otherwise first to engage wins | Protect partner investment |
| **Direct customer wants to move to a partner** | Allowed — partner receives that account going forward | Don't penalise flexibility |
| **Partner customer contacts DoppelDown directly** | Route to partner (inform customer, cc partner) | Honour partner relationship |
| **Two partners pursuing the same prospect** | First registered deal wins; 14-day head start | Fair first-mover advantage |
| **Partner raises price above DoppelDown list** | Allowed — partner owns their pricing with their clients | Partner autonomy |
| **Partner discounts below DoppelDown list** | Discouraged but not prohibited; addressed in QBR | Protect market pricing |
| **Customer churns from partner, signs up directly** | Allowed after 90-day cooling period; partner notified | Can't hold customers hostage |

### Pricing Protection

- **DoppelDown will never undercut partner pricing to win a deal.** If a partner is quoting $199/mo to their client, DoppelDown won't offer the client $149/mo directly. This is sacred.
- **DoppelDown's direct pricing is the "ceiling."** Partners buy below list and sell at list or higher. The published price protects the partner's margin.
- **Promotional pricing applies equally.** If DoppelDown runs a promotion, partners get an equivalent or better offer.

### Deal Registration Process

```
1. Partner submits deal registration:
   - Company name, domain, contact name/email
   - Expected tier and timeline
   - Brief description of opportunity

2. DoppelDown reviews within 48 hours:
   - Check for existing direct relationship
   - Check for competing deal registrations
   - Approve, reject, or flag for discussion

3. If approved:
   - Additional 10-15% discount on that deal
   - 90-day exclusivity window (renewable once)
   - DoppelDown routes any inbound from that prospect to the partner

4. Deal outcome:
   - Closed won → partner receives credited discount
   - Closed lost → registration expires
   - Expired → deal open to other partners or direct

### Year 1 Summary

| Metric | Year End (Month 12) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Total partners (all tiers) | 28-33 |
| Client brands under management | 200+ |
| Partner-sourced MRR | ~$18,500 |
| Partner-sourced ARR | ~$222,000 |
| % of total MRR from channels | 40-45% |
| Commission payouts (referral partners) | ~$1,200/month |
| Net partner-sourced MRR (after commissions) | ~$17,300 |

### Year 2 Projection

| Metric | Year 2 Target |
|--------|-------------|
| Total partners | 50-75 |
| Client brands under management | 500-800 |
| Partner-sourced MRR | $35,000-$50,000 |
| Partner-sourced ARR | $420,000-$600,000 |
| White-label deals | 2-3 |
| Technology integrations active | 5-8 |

### Partner LTV vs. Direct Customer LTV

| Metric | Direct Customer | Partner-Managed Customer |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Average MRR | $120 | $100 (net after partner discount) |
| Average lifespan | 14 months | 22 months (stickier) |
| LTV | $1,680 | $2,200 |
| CAC | $100-300 | $50-150 (amortised across partner's client base) |
| LTV:CAC ratio | 5.6-16.8:1 | 14.7-44:1 |

**Partner-managed customers have nearly 3x the LTV:CAC ratio** because the MSP/agency relationship provides stickiness that DoppelDown can't replicate in a direct relationship.

## 17. Legal & Compliance Framework

### Partner Agreement (Key Terms)

The partner agreement should be simple, fair, and not require a lawyer to understand.

| Clause | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| **Term** | 12-month auto-renewing; either party can cancel with 30 days notice |
| **Territory** | Non-exclusive; partner can sell anywhere (no geographic restrictions initially) |
| **Pricing** | DoppelDown sets list prices; partner discount per tier level; partner sets own retail price |
| **Commission** | Referral track: 20% of Year 1 payments; paid monthly, net 30; min payout $50 |
| **IP** | DoppelDown owns all product IP; partner granted limited licence to use logos/trademarks for resale |
| **Co-branding** | Partner may co-brand reports and materials per DoppelDown brand guidelines |
| **Confidentiality** | Both parties protect each other's confidential information; standard NDA terms |
| **Data protection** | Partner responsible for client data handling; DoppelDown processes data per Privacy Policy |
| **Liability** | Standard limitation of liability; DoppelDown provides the platform "as-is" to partners |
| **Termination** | Either party, 30 days notice; client accounts continue (transfer to direct or another partner) |
| **Non-compete** | None (partners can carry competing products) |
| **Minimum commitment** | Reseller: 3 client brands within 90 days; Referral: no minimum |

### Data Processing & Privacy

| Item | Approach |
|------|----------|
| **Data controller** | Client is data controller; DoppelDown is data processor; partner is sub-processor (if managing client account) |
| **Data processing agreement** | Included as addendum to partner agreement |
| **Data access** | Partner sees only their clients' data; DoppelDown sees all data for service delivery and support |
| **Data portability** | Clients can export their data at any time |
| **Data retention** | Per tier limits (7 days - 2 years); partner can request extended retention at additional cost |
| **Breach notification** | DoppelDown notifies partner within 72 hours of a data breach affecting partner's client data |

---

## 18. Risk Register & Contingencies

### Partnership-Specific Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Partners don't sell actively** — sign up but never pitch to clients | High | High | 60-day activation requirement; proactive enablement; NFR accounts create personal investment; "Found Something" technique makes first pitch easy |
| **Partner misrepresents DoppelDown** — oversells capabilities | Medium | High | Clear partner guidelines; approved messaging; co-branded materials; regular QBR reviews |
| **Partner undercuts on pricing** — sells below list | Low | Medium | Not prohibited but addressed in QBR; list price published on website creates expectation |
| **Key partner churns** — takes clients with them | Medium | High | Direct client relationships where possible; ensure client value is tied to DoppelDown product, not just partner; 90-day transition period |
| **Channel conflict** — partner and direct compete on same deal | Medium | Medium | Clear deal registration rules (Section 13); partner wins registered deals; transparent process |
| **Partner demands features DoppelDown can't build yet** — white-label, custom integrations | High | Medium | Transparent roadmap sharing; prioritise features that benefit multiple partners; partner advisory board for input |
| **Slow partner portal development** — manual processes don't scale | Medium | High | Invest in partner portal MVP early (Phase 2); automate billing and reporting first; accept manual workarounds for Phase 1 |
| **Commission/discount costs eat into margin** | Low | Medium | Model economics before setting rates; review quarterly; adjust tiers if needed |

### Contingency Plans

**If no partners sign in first 3 months:**
1. Is the value proposition clear? Survey 10 MSPs on what they'd need to add brand protection.
2. Increase NFR generosity — give 5 free brands for 180 days instead of 2 for 90.
3. Offer a "co-marketing sprint" — DoppelDown pays for LinkedIn ads promoting the partner's security services (with brand protection included).
4. Consider the partner-as-customer model: target the MSP's own brand protection needs first, then expand to their clients.

**If partners sign but don't sell:**
1. Diagnosis: Is the product hard to demo? Is the sales conversation unclear? Are margins too low?
2. Treatment: Run a "partner activation sprint" — 2 weeks of daily check-ins, joint prospect calls, and hands-on support with their first 3 client pitches.
3. Create a "done-for-you first pitch" service — Richard will join the partner's first client pitch and run the demo live.
4. Implement a 60-day activation deadline: partners who haven't onboarded 1 client brand in 60 days get a "what's blocking you?" call.

**If a major competitor launches an SMB channel program:**
1. Accelerate partner acquisition — sign as many partners as possible before the competitor scales.
2. Emphasise DoppelDown's advantages: transparent pricing, self-serve, lower minimums, better partner margins.
3. Lock in key partners with Platinum-level benefits and longer-term agreements.
4. Create switching content: "Why MSPs choose DoppelDown over [Competitor's New Program]."

## 19. Appendix — Templates & Assets

### A. Partner Outreach Email Templates

#### Template 1: Warm Network MSP (Phone Follow-Up)

> Subject: Following up on our chat — brand protection partner opportunity
>
> Hey [Name],
>
> Great chatting earlier. As promised, here's the summary:
>
> **DoppelDown** — AI-powered brand protection for SMBs. The only tool with transparent pricing ($79-$499/mo) in a market where every competitor charges $50K+/year.
>
> **Partner opportunity for [MSP Name]:**
> - Buy at 25% below list price → resell to your clients at list or higher
> - Adds $150-$500/month per client as a new service line
> - Zero delivery overhead — AI handles scanning, you deliver reports
> - I'll give you 2 free NFR licenses + 5 client brands free for 90 days to evaluate
>
> **Next step:** I'll set up your evaluation account this week. Just need:
> 1. Your email for the account
> 2. Your MSP's domain (I'll run it as a demo)
> 3. 2-3 client domains you'd like to scan
>
> Happy to jump on another call to walk through the partner portal once it's set up.
>
> Cheers,
> Richard

#### Template 2: Cold MSP Outreach

> Subject: Brand protection revenue opportunity for [MSP Name]
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> Quick question: do any of your clients ask about brand impersonation or phishing protection?
>
> I built DoppelDown — the only self-serve brand protection platform priced for SMBs ($79-$499/mo vs. the $50K+/year enterprise tools charge).
>
> I'm launching a partner program for MSPs:
> - **25% partner discount** → resell at list or mark up further
> - **Zero delivery overhead** — AI scans for typosquatting, phishing sites, social impersonation
> - **Multi-brand management** — manage all client brands from one dashboard
> - **Co-branded reports** — your logo on threat reports you deliver to clients
>
> The math: 10 clients × $199/mo = $1,990/mo in new revenue. Your cost: $1,493/mo. That's $500/month in pure margin for a service you don't have to deliver.
>
> I've set aside 5 free evaluation brands for MSPs who want to try it. Interested?
>
> Richard Dobson
> Founder, DoppelDown
> [partner page link]

#### Template 3: Agency Outreach

> Subject: Protect the brands you build
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> You spend months building your clients' brands. But is anyone protecting them?
>
> Brand impersonation attacks are up 300%+ — fake domains, phishing sites, social media copycats. Your clients are targets, and most agencies don't have an answer when the client asks "what are we doing about this?"
>
> **DoppelDown** is brand protection for the rest of us — AI-powered monitoring from $79/month, not $50K/year like the enterprise tools.
>
> For agencies, I'm offering:
> - 20% commission on every client you refer (first 12 months)
> - OR 20% reseller discount if you prefer to manage client relationships
> - Free evaluation account with 3 client brands
> - Co-branded threat reports with your agency logo
>
> Want to see what turns up for your clients? I'll run a free scan on any brand you choose.
>
> Richard Dobson

### C. Partner Demo Script

```
PARTNER DEMO SCRIPT (30 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════

OPENING (5 minutes)
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. Before I show 
you the product, I want to understand your business. 
How many clients do you manage? Do any of them ask 
about brand protection or phishing? Have any experienced 
brand impersonation?"

[Listen actively — their answers shape the rest of the demo]

LIVE SCAN — PARTNER'S OWN BRAND (10 minutes)
"Let me show you something real. I'm going to scan 
[partner's domain] right now. This is what your clients 
would see."

[Run scan live. If threats found, highlight them. 
If not, show the variations that could be registered.]

"See these 4 active domains? Someone registered variations 
of your brand name. [This one] even has MX records — that 
means they could be sending emails pretending to be you."

LIVE SCAN — PARTNER'S CLIENT (5 minutes)
"Now let's try one of your client's domains."

[Run scan on a client domain the partner suggested.]

"This is the conversation you'd have with your client. 
You just found threats they didn't know about. You're 
not selling them a tool — you're showing them a problem 
and a solution."

PARTNER ECONOMICS (5 minutes)
