# Battle Card: DoppelDown vs. Enterprise Vendors
*Last updated: 2026-02-05 | Confidence: High*
*Use this card when competing against ANY enterprise brand protection vendor (ZeroFox, BrandShield, Netcraft, Doppel, etc.)*

---

## The Situation

The prospect is evaluating DoppelDown alongside an enterprise vendor. They may have already received a quote of $2,000-$15,000/month or been told to "contact sales."

## Their Pitch (Generic Enterprise)
> "We're the industry leader in digital risk protection. Our platform provides comprehensive coverage with managed takedown services, backed by a team of security analysts and years of threat intelligence data."

## Our Counter-Pitch
> "DoppelDown delivers the same AI-powered brand protection — domain monitoring, visual analysis, phishing detection, evidence collection — at a fraction of the cost, with instant self-serve setup. No sales calls, no 6-month onboarding, no $50K annual contracts. You can be monitoring your brand in 5 minutes for free."

## The Core Argument

```
Enterprise Vendor                          DoppelDown
─────────────────                          ──────────
$2,000-$15,000/month                       $79-$499/month
"Contact sales" → weeks                   Sign up now → 5 minutes
Annual contract required                   Month-to-month
6-week onboarding                          Instant time-to-value
Need to justify budget to CFO             Business credit card
Opaque feature bundling                    Clear feature tiers
"Trust our analysts"                       AI + transparency
```

## Where Enterprise Vendors Win (Be Honest)

| Their Advantage | Reality Check | Our Response |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Managed takedowns** — They execute takedowns for you | True advantage. DoppelDown generates takedown reports but doesn't execute. | "Our reports give you everything you need to submit takedowns yourself. For most SMBs, this is sufficient. We're building automated takedown partnerships." |
| **Dark web monitoring** — Some include dark web coverage | Nice-to-have for enterprise, overkill for most SMBs | "Dark web monitoring is on our roadmap. For most growing brands, domain and social monitoring catches threats before they reach the dark web." |
| **Compliance certifications** — SOC 2, FedRAMP, etc. | Important for enterprise procurement, not for SMBs | "Our enterprise tier includes compliance documentation. For SOC 2 certification specifically, we're in progress." |
| **Analyst team** — Human analysts augmenting AI | More labor-intensive, not necessarily better | "Our AI handles the analysis automatically. You see results instantly, not after an analyst reviews them during business hours." |
| **Track record** — Years of operation | Legitimate concern for risk-averse buyers | "We're built on proven AI technology and modern architecture. Every enterprise vendor was new once — and they didn't offer free trials." |

## Where DoppelDown Wins

| Our Advantage | How to Prove It |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **10-25x cheaper** | "Their entry price is $2K/month. Ours is $79/month. Same core protection." |
| **Instant setup** | "Sign up right now. You'll see your first threat results in under 5 minutes. Try doing that with [competitor]." |
| **Transparent pricing** | "Go to their website and try to find a price. You can't. Our pricing is on our website for everyone to see." |
| **Free tier** | "Start for free, no credit card required. When's the last time an enterprise vendor offered you that?" |
| **Month-to-month** | "No annual lock-in. If you don't love it, cancel anytime. Enterprise vendors lock you in for 12-36 months." |
| **AI-first** | "Our AI analyzes every threat automatically — visual similarity, phishing intent, risk scoring. No waiting for a human analyst." |
| **Modern UX** | "Clean, fast, intuitive dashboard designed for humans, not enterprise SOC teams." |

## Pricing Comparison

| | Enterprise Vendor (Avg) | DoppelDown Business | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Monthly cost** | $3,000-$5,000 | $199 | 93-96% |
| **Annual cost** | $36,000-$60,000 | $1,908 (annual) | 95-97% |
| **Setup/onboarding** | $5,000-$15,000 | $0 | 100% |
| **Contract minimum** | 12-36 months | None (month-to-month) | ∞ flexibility |
| **Total Year 1** | $41,000-$75,000 | $1,908-$2,388 | **95-97%** |

> **Framing**: "Would you rather spend $60K to protect your brand, or $2,400 to protect your brand and keep $57,600 for growth?"

## Objection Handling

| Prospect Says | You Say |
|---|---|
| **"[Competitor] has more features"** | "Which features specifically? Most enterprise features are designed for 1,000+ person companies with dedicated security teams. If you need domain monitoring, AI analysis, evidence collection, and alerting — we have everything you need at 1/15th the cost." |
| **"[Competitor] is more established"** | "They are — and they charge 15x more partly because of that overhead. Our AI technology is cutting-edge, and we're the first brand protection platform to offer transparent, self-serve pricing. You can verify our quality with our free tier right now." |
| **"I need managed takedowns"** | "Our takedown reports include all the evidence and documentation you need. Most takedowns are a simple email to the registrar or hosting provider — our reports template that for you. Paying $3,000/month for someone to send emails you can send yourself isn't great ROI." |
| **"My CISO wants a known vendor"** | "Understandable. Start with our free tier — let the results speak for themselves. Once your CISO sees the AI threat analysis, evidence packages, and the 95% cost savings, the conversation changes." |
| **"We need SOC 2 compliance"** | "Our Enterprise tier includes compliance documentation. Full SOC 2 certification is in progress. For context, many of our competitors weren't SOC 2 certified at our stage either." |
| **"What if you go out of business?"** | "Fair question. Unlike VC-funded competitors burning cash to grow, we're built lean and profitable. You can export all your data anytime. And with month-to-month billing, you're never locked in — your risk is literally $199." |
| **"The enterprise vendor gave us a demo and it looked amazing"** | "Demos are designed to look amazing. Sign up for DoppelDown's free tier and compare the actual results side-by-side. Not a demo — your real brand, your real threats. That's a comparison no enterprise vendor will offer." |

## Trap Questions (Ask the Prospect These)

These questions highlight DoppelDown's advantages without directly attacking the competitor:

1. **"What's their published pricing?"** → They don't have one. We do.
2. **"How quickly can you see your first results?"** → With us: 5 minutes. With them: weeks.
3. **"What's the minimum annual commitment?"** → With us: $0 (free tier exists). With them: $24K-$60K+.
4. **"Can you try before you buy?"** → With us: free tier, forever. With them: a 30-minute demo.
5. **"What happens if you want to cancel after 3 months?"** → With us: cancel anytime. With them: you're locked in.
6. **"How many brands can you monitor for $5,000/month?"** → With us, that's our Enterprise tier × 10 months. Unlimited brands.

## Competitive Positioning Statement

> "Enterprise brand protection vendors built their businesses when only Fortune 500 companies could afford protection. DoppelDown was built for the rest of us. Same AI-powered detection, same evidence collection, same takedown reports — without the enterprise markup, the sales calls, or the 12-month lock-in."

---

## When to Walk Away

Be honest: DoppelDown isn't the right fit if the prospect:
- **Needs managed takedown execution** (we report, we don't execute... yet)
- **Has strict FedRAMP/IL5 compliance requirements** (we're not there yet)
- **Needs dark web monitoring** (not currently offered)
- **Has 1,000+ brands to monitor with custom SLAs** (enterprise custom needed)
- **Requires dedicated account management** (small team, limited bandwidth)

In these cases, acknowledge the gap, offer what you can, and stay in touch for when you grow into those capabilities.
