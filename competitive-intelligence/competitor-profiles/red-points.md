## Competitive Overlap

**Low-moderate overlap with DoppelDown.** Red Points is primarily a counterfeit/marketplace protection tool. DoppelDown is primarily a phishing/domain abuse protection tool. They overlap on domain monitoring and social media monitoring.

**When we'd compete**: Mid-market companies needing both brand monitoring and marketplace monitoring. In this case, DoppelDown covers the phishing/domain side, Red Points covers the marketplace side — could even be complementary.

## Intelligence Gaps

- [ ] Actual pricing tiers
- [ ] Plans for phishing/domain abuse expansion
- [ ] Self-serve roadmap
- [ ] Customer overlap with DoppelDown's target market

## Monitoring Priority

🟡 **MEDIUM** — Different primary focus (marketplace vs. domains). Monitor monthly.
