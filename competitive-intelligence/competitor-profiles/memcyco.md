## Company Overview

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Company** | Memcyco |
| **Founded** | 2021 |
| **HQ** | Tel Aviv, Israel |
| **Employees** | ~30-60 |
| **Funding** | $25M+ |
| **Est. Revenue** | $5-10M ARR |
| **Target Market** | Enterprise (financial services, e-commerce) |

## Product Overview

Memcyco takes a unique approach: instead of just detecting phishing sites, they provide **real-time protection for end-users** who land on phishing sites. They embed a "digital watermark" in legitimate sites that's absent from fakes, enabling real-time alerts to end users.

### Core Capabilities
- Real-time website impersonation detection
- Digital watermark verification technology
- End-user phishing alerts (victims see warnings in real-time)
- Brand impersonation monitoring
- Credential exposure detection

### Key Differentiator: Real-Time End-User Protection
Most DRP tools protect the brand. Memcyco also protects the brand's *customers* by alerting them in real-time when they're on a phishing page. This is a genuinely different approach.

## Why It Matters to DoppelDown

**Low-medium threat.** Different approach and price point. Watch because:
- Innovative technology that could become table stakes
- Well-funded Israeli startup with VC momentum
- Could influence buyer expectations about what "brand protection" means
- If their approach becomes standard, DoppelDown may need similar capabilities

## Pricing: Enterprise sales only, estimated $3,000-$8,000/mo

## Monitoring Priority: 🟡 **MEDIUM** — Innovative approach worth watching. Quarterly deep review.

## Intelligence Gaps
- [ ] Actual watermark technology effectiveness
- [ ] Customer adoption rates
- [ ] Plans for SMB/self-serve
- [ ] Integration with existing brand protection workflows
