## Strengths (Honest Assessment)

| Strength | Impact on DoppelDown |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Market leader brand recognition** — Widely known in cybersecurity | Customers may default to them without exploring alternatives |
| **Comprehensive coverage** — Domain, social, dark web, physical | Feature gap for DoppelDown in multiple areas |
| **Managed takedown services** — Actually execute takedowns, not just report | Major differentiation gap |
| **Threat intelligence depth** — Large data moat from years of collection | Hard to replicate quickly |
| **SOC 2, FedRAMP compliant** — Enterprise-ready | Blocks DoppelDown from some enterprise deals |
| **Partner ecosystem** — Integrations with SIEMs, SOARs, CrowdStrike, etc. | Reduces switching likelihood for existing customers |

## Weaknesses (Our Opportunities)

| Weakness | DoppelDown Advantage |
|----------|---------------------|

| **Heavy platform** — Feature bloat for simpler use cases | DoppelDown: focused, clean, fast |
| **SPAC/PE dynamics** — Taken private, likely cost-cutting | Potential product quality and support degradation |
| **Legacy architecture** — 10+ years of tech debt | DoppelDown: modern AI-first tech stack |
| **No free trial** — Customers buy blind after demos | DoppelDown: free tier lets you experience value first |

- [ ] Customer satisfaction trends since going private
