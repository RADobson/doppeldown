## Product Overview

Allure Security focuses on AI-powered brand protection with a unique "decoy" approach — they plant trackable decoy data on phishing sites to identify when stolen credentials are used.

- Phishing site monitoring and takedown
- Decoy/deception technology (unique differentiator)
- Social media monitoring
- Domain monitoring

### Key Differentiator: Decoy Technology
Allure plants fake credentials and tracking data on detected phishing sites. When these decoys are "harvested" and used, it provides intelligence on threat actors and proves the phishing site was active. This is unique in the market.
