## Product Overview

Netcraft is the oldest player in anti-phishing and brand protection. Originally an internet research company (famous for the Netcraft Web Server Survey), they pivoted to cybercrime disruption. Acquired by Spectrum Equity PE in 2023 — signaling growth ambitions.

### Core Capabilities
- **Phishing site detection** — Industry-leading, processes for all major browsers
- **Domain monitoring** — Comprehensive typosquatting and lookalike detection
- **Takedown services** — Industry-leading automated takedown with ~24hr average
- **Certificate Transparency monitoring** — Strong CT log analysis
- **Malicious site blocking** — Feeds to browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari safe browsing)
- **App monitoring** — Fake app detection in app stores
- **Email fraud detection** — DMARC-based protection

### Key Differentiators
- **Takedown speed** — Claims fastest takedown times in the industry
- **Browser integration** — Their data feeds into safe browsing databases (massive distribution)
- **30-year data moat** — Decades of internet infrastructure data
- **Government contracts** — UK government and financial sector relationships
- **Free tools** — Site report, extension, and some free scanning tools

## Pricing & Packaging

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Pricing Model** | Enterprise sales, annual contracts |
| **Pricing Transparency** | ❌ "Contact us" for commercial products |
| **Estimated Price Range** | $5,000-$25,000/month for enterprise |
| **Free Tier** | ✅ Free tools (site report, browser extension) but NOT free monitoring |
| **Self-Serve** | ❌ For commercial products |

## Strengths

| Strength | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **30-year track record** — Oldest and most established | Massive credibility advantage |
| **Takedown speed** — Industry-leading automated takedowns | Major feature gap for DoppelDown |
| **Browser safe browsing feeds** — Data reaches billions of users | Unique distribution/data advantage |
| **PE-backed growth** — Spectrum Equity brings resources | Will be aggressively growing |
| **Free tools** — Site report drives awareness | Some PLG-adjacent motion |
| **Government/financial verticals** — Deep trust in regulated industries | Blocks DoppelDown in those verticals |

## Weaknesses

| Weakness | DoppelDown Advantage |
|----------|---------------------|
| **No self-serve commercial product** | DoppelDown: instant self-serve |
| **No transparent pricing** | DoppelDown: published pricing |
| **Enterprise minimum** — $60K+/year | DoppelDown: $0 to $499/mo |
| **Aging UX** — Functional but dated interface | DoppelDown: modern, clean UX |
| **Limited social media monitoring** | DoppelDown: integrated social scanning |
| **PE ownership** — Profit optimization may degrade experience | DoppelDown: founder-led, customer-first |

## Notable: Free Tools Ecosystem

Netcraft's free tools are worth understanding:
- **Netcraft Extension** — Browser extension flagging phishing sites
- **Site Report** — Public URL/domain reputation lookup
- **Phishing Site Feed** — Community-contributed phishing reports

These create awareness but don't compete directly with DoppelDown's monitoring product. However, they demonstrate PLG thinking that other enterprise competitors lack.

## Intelligence Gaps

- [ ] Post-PE acquisition product roadmap
- [ ] Plans for SMB or self-serve pricing
- [ ] Impact of Spectrum Equity investment on growth strategy
- [ ] New product launches planned
- [ ] Hiring patterns (especially growth/PLG roles)

## Monitoring Priority

🟡 **MEDIUM** — Deeply enterprise-focused but PE acquisition could drive market expansion. Monitor monthly, especially for product changes.
