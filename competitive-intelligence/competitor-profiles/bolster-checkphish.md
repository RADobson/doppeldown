## Strengths

| Strength | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **Free tools (CheckPhish)** — Only competitor with PLG-adjacent motion | Directly competes with DoppelDown's free tier concept |
| **Microsoft investment** — M12 backing = credibility and potential Azure integration | Could gain enterprise distribution |
| **AI-powered takedowns** — Automated end-to-end | Feature gap for DoppelDown |
| **API-first design** — Developer-friendly | Appeals to technical buyers |

| **Strong phishing focus** — Deep expertise in phishing detection | Specialized quality |

## Weaknesses

| Weakness | DoppelDown Advantage |
|----------|---------------------|
| **CheckPhish is limited** — Free tools are basic, no comprehensive monitoring | DoppelDown free tier is more complete |
| **Enterprise product requires sales** | DoppelDown: self-serve at every tier |
| **No transparent pricing for Bolster** | DoppelDown: published pricing |
| **Gap between free and enterprise** — No mid-market self-serve path | DoppelDown: $79/mo Growth tier bridges the gap |
| **Niche focus on phishing** — Less broad brand protection | DoppelDown: broader brand protection scope |
| **Brand confusion** — CheckPhish vs. Bolster naming is confusing | DoppelDown: one brand, clear proposition |

## Critical Comparison: CheckPhish Free vs. DoppelDown Free

| Feature | CheckPhish Free | DoppelDown Free | DoppelDown Advantage |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| URL scanning | ✅ Unlimited | ✅ (limited) | CheckPhish stronger here |
| Domain monitoring | Basic | ✅ 1 brand, 10 variations | DoppelDown: actual monitoring |
| Typosquat detection | ✅ One-time check | ✅ Ongoing monitoring | DoppelDown: continuous |
| AI risk scoring | ✅ Basic | ✅ Domain risk scoring | Comparable |
| Dashboard | ❌ | ✅ Full dashboard | DoppelDown wins |
| Alerts | ❌ | ❌ (paid) | Tie |
| Reports | ❌ | ❌ (paid) | Tie |
| Social monitoring | ❌ | ✅ 1 platform | DoppelDown wins |
| Account/login | Optional | ✅ Required | DoppelDown captures user data |

**Key insight**: CheckPhish's free tool is a standalone scanner; DoppelDown's free tier is a reduced version of the full platform. DoppelDown's approach is better for conversion to paid.
