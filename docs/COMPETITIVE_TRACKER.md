## Competitive Positioning Summary

### Our Unique Position
```
"Enterprise-grade brand protection at SMB prices, with self-serve access and AI-powered signal-over-noise."
```

### Key Differentiators (ranked by defensibility)
1. **Price transparency** — No "contact sales", pricing on the website
2. **Time-to-value** — First scan in <5 minutes, no onboarding calls
3. **AI threat scoring** — Less noise than rule-based competitors
4. **Free tier** — Try before you buy, builds data moat
5. **Modern UX** — Clean, fast, mobile-friendly (vs clunky enterprise tools)

### Where We're Weaker (be honest)
1. **Takedown capabilities** — Enterprise tools have legal teams and registrar relationships
2. **Marketplace monitoring** — Red Points specializes here, we don't cover it (yet)
3. **Depth of analysis** — PhishLabs has human analysts for deep investigation
4. **Track record** — New product vs established players with Fortune 500 logos
5. **Dark web monitoring** — Not in scope currently

### Competitive Moat Development

| Moat | Current State | 6-Month Target | 12-Month Target |
|------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Data moat (scan volume) | ~0 brands | 500+ brands scanned | 2,000+ brands |
| Integration moat | Zero integrations | Slack + API | 5+ integrations |
| Community moat | No community | PH + Reddit presence | Newsletter + user community |
| Price moat | Priced but unvalidated | 50+ paying customers prove model | Sustainable unit economics proven |
