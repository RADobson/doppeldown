## 1. Executive Summary

### The Strategic Insight

The brand protection market is a **$3.5B+ industry built on gatekeeping**. Every major player — BrandShield, ZeroFox, Bolster, Red Points, PhishLabs, Netcraft — follows the same playbook: hide pricing, require sales calls, lock customers into six-figure annual contracts, and serve only enterprises. This has created an enormous, underserved gap:

> **Millions of businesses know they're vulnerable to brand impersonation but believe they can't afford to do anything about it.**

DoppelDown's positioning doesn't just exploit this gap — it reframes the entire market conversation. We're not "the cheap alternative." We're the company that believes brand protection is a right, not a luxury. That reframe is the foundation of everything in this document.

### What This Document Covers

## 2. Brand Foundation

### Mission Statement

**Make brand protection accessible to every business, not just the ones with enterprise security budgets.**

*Why this works:* It positions DoppelDown against the status quo (gatekept, expensive, enterprise-only) without naming competitors. It implies a moral stance — that the current state of affairs is wrong — which creates emotional resonance and differentiation simultaneously.

### Vision Statement

**A world where no business loses customers to impersonators simply because they couldn't afford to detect the threat.**

*Why this works:* It's aspirational but grounded. It paints a specific negative outcome (losing customers to impersonators) and ties it to a specific injustice (affordability). This makes the vision tangible and emotionally motivating, rather than generic ("be the leading...").

### Core Values

These aren't wall art. They're decision-making filters that shape product, marketing, and customer experience.

| Value | What It Means in Practice | How It Shows Up |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **Transparency** | If we make customers guess, we've failed. | Pricing on the website. No "contact sales." No hidden fees. Plain-English reports. Status page is public. |
| **Accessibility** | If only technical people can use it, we've failed. | 5-minute onboarding. No jargon in the UI. Free tier exists. No minimum contracts. |
| **Substance Over Theatre** | We'd rather catch one real threat than generate 100 false positives. | AI scoring to reduce noise. Evidence collection for every finding. No vanity metrics. |
| **Founder Empathy** | We built this because we saw the problem firsthand. | The product solves a specific pain Richard witnessed in cybersecurity. Customer support is human. We listen. |
| **Speed to Value** | The time between "I have a problem" and "here's the answer" should be minutes, not months. | Self-serve signup. Instant scan results. Same-day deployment. No 30-day implementation. |

### Brand Pillars

Three pillars support every piece of DoppelDown communication:

## 3. Positioning Framework

### Positioning Statement (Internal)

> **For small and mid-size businesses** that are vulnerable to brand impersonation but priced out of existing solutions, **DoppelDown** is the **AI-powered brand protection platform** that **lets you detect fake domains, phishing sites, and social media impersonation in minutes — with transparent pricing starting at $0/month**. Unlike enterprise vendors like BrandShield, ZeroFox, and Bolster, **DoppelDown requires no sales call, no annual contract, and no security team to operate.**

### Positioning Statement (External / Customer-Facing)

> **Brand protection for the rest of us.**
> AI-powered. Self-serve. Transparent pricing. See who's impersonating your brand in minutes — not months.

### Category Definition

DoppelDown intentionally operates at the intersection of two categories while belonging fully to neither:

| Category | The Problem | DoppelDown's Relationship |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Enterprise Digital Risk Protection (DRP)** | Serves only large enterprises at $15K–$300K/yr | We deliver comparable capabilities at 1/50th the price |
| **SMB Security Tools** | Generic security (antivirus, firewall, email security) — no brand-specific protection | We fill the brand protection gap in the SMB security stack |

**Strategic category creation:** Rather than competing in "Digital Risk Protection" (where we'll always be framed as "cheap") or "SMB Security" (where brand protection is invisible), DoppelDown defines a new micro-category:

> **Self-Serve Brand Protection**

This category doesn't exist yet. By naming it, we own it. The category definition implicitly disqualifies every competitor:
- Enterprise vendors aren't "self-serve"
- Free tools (dnstwist, Google Alerts) aren't "brand protection"
- Generic SMB security tools don't cover brands

### Positioning Map

                              │       (unique position)
                              │
                    SMB-ACCESSIBLE PRICING
```

**DoppelDown occupies the only open quadrant:** enterprise-grade capabilities (AI analysis, evidence collection, automated monitoring) delivered with open access (self-serve, transparent pricing, free tier). No other player sits here because incumbent business models depend on the opposite quadrant.

### Why Competitors Can't Follow

This isn't just a positioning exercise — it's a structural moat:

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cannibalization** | If BrandShield offered a $99/mo tier, their $50K/yr enterprise customers would revolt. They can't move downmarket without destroying their core business. |
| **Sales team dependency** | Competitors have large enterprise sales orgs with $200K+ OTE. Self-serve eliminates the need for those teams — but those teams won't vote to eliminate themselves. |
| **Architecture mismatch** | Enterprise platforms are built for white-glove onboarding with human analysts. Rebuilding for self-serve is a multi-year replatforming effort. |
| **Brand perception** | Enterprise vendors marketing to SMBs risks cheapening their brand in the eyes of their core buyers. "Why would I pay you $50K when you sell the same thing for $99?" |

**This is the Innovator's Dilemma applied to brand protection.** DoppelDown is the disruptor at the bottom of the market that incumbents rationally choose to ignore.

## 4. Brand Narrative & Origin Story

### The Founder's Story (Long Form — for blog, about page, PR)

> I spent years in cybersecurity watching businesses get destroyed by something they didn't even know was happening.
>
> A customer would call in a panic — "Someone cloned our website." "There's a fake LinkedIn profile using our CEO's name." "Our clients are getting phishing emails that look like they're from us."
>
> And every time, the same conversation followed:
>
> **"How do we stop this?"**
>
> The honest answer? You can. But it'll cost you $30,000 to $300,000 a year for enterprise tools that require a six-month implementation and a dedicated security team to operate.
>
> For the Fortune 500 companies I worked with, that was fine. They'd write the cheque and move on.
>
> But the small business owner across the street? The e-commerce brand doing $2 million a year? The startup that just raised a Series A? They were stuck. They couldn't afford the tools, couldn't find the pricing (because nobody publishes it), and couldn't dedicate a security analyst to the problem.
>
> I watched business after business get told the same thing: **"You're too small for us."**
>
> That's the dirty secret of brand protection: the industry doesn't serve the businesses that need it most.
>
> Phishing attacks don't discriminate by company size. Typosquatters don't check your revenue before registering a fake domain. Brand impersonators target whoever they can — and smaller businesses are easier targets because they usually have no defenses at all.
>
> I kept thinking: this is fixable. AI can do what human analyst teams do — scan domains, analyze phishing pages, score threats — at a fraction of the cost. Self-serve onboarding can replace multi-week implementations. Transparent pricing can replace the "contact sales" black box.
>
> So I built DoppelDown.
>
> The name is a bet: I'm doubling down on the belief that every business deserves to know if someone is impersonating their brand. Not just the ones that can write a six-figure cheque.
>
> DoppelDown scans for fake domains, phishing sites, and social media impersonation. It collects evidence automatically. AI scores every threat so you're not drowning in noise. And pricing is right on the website — $0 to $499 a month. No sales call. No annual contract. No "let me check with my team."
>
> I didn't build this because I love cybersecurity tooling. I built it because I saw an injustice in the market and I had the skills to fix it.
>
> If someone is impersonating your brand right now, you should be able to find out today. Not after a three-week sales process and a $50,000 purchase order.
>
> That's what DoppelDown does.

### The Founder's Story (Short Form — for Product Hunt, LinkedIn, cold outreach)

> I spent years in cybersecurity watching brands get impersonated — and watching the "solutions" charge $50K+/year while hiding their pricing behind "Contact Sales."
>
> Small businesses were left completely unprotected. Not because the technology didn't exist, but because nobody would sell it to them at a fair price.
>
> So I built DoppelDown: AI-powered brand protection with transparent pricing starting at $0/month. Sign up, scan your brand, see threats in 5 minutes. No sales call required.
>
> Brand protection shouldn't be a luxury. It should be accessible.

### The Company Story (Third Person — for press, analyst briefings)

> DoppelDown was founded in 2026 by Richard Dobson, a cybersecurity professional who spent years watching businesses fall victim to brand impersonation while existing solutions priced them out of protection. Recognizing that AI could deliver enterprise-grade threat detection at a fraction of the cost, Dobson built DoppelDown as the first self-serve brand protection platform with transparent, published pricing — starting at $0/month.
>
> DoppelDown uses AI-powered scanning to detect typosquatting domains, phishing sites, and social media impersonation targeting a brand. It automatically collects evidence (screenshots, WHOIS data, DNS records, HTML archives), scores threats by severity, and generates takedown reports — capabilities previously available only through enterprise vendors charging $15,000–$300,000+ per year.
>
> The company serves small and mid-size businesses, digital marketing agencies, and managed security providers (MSPs/MSSPs) who need brand protection without enterprise budgets or multi-week onboarding processes.

### Narrative Themes to Reinforce Across All Content

| Theme | Why It Works | Where to Use |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **"Brand protection for the rest of us"** | Immediately positions against enterprise-only incumbents. Creates in-group identity. | Tagline, headlines, social media bios |
| **"The industry's dirty secret"** | Triggers curiosity and frustration. Makes the buyer feel validated. | Blog posts, LinkedIn thought leadership, PR pitches |
| **"You're not too small"** | Directly addresses the objection SMBs have heard from vendors. Emotionally resonant. | Landing page, sales conversations, case studies |
| **"Find out today, not after a sales process"** | Speed-to-value is the most tangible differentiator. | CTAs, product descriptions, comparison pages |
| **"The Innovator's Dilemma, applied"** | For technical/startup audiences who appreciate the strategic framing. | Hacker News, Indie Hackers, startup communities |
| **"Every business deserves to know"** | Moral framing that elevates the brand beyond a feature comparison. | Mission statement, about page, founder content |

## 5. Messaging Architecture

The messaging architecture is a hierarchy: each level builds on the one above it. This ensures consistency across all channels and team members.

### Level 1: Core Message (The Single Truth)

> **If someone is impersonating your brand, you should be able to find out today — regardless of your budget.**

This is the irreducible idea behind DoppelDown. Every piece of communication should trace back to this.

### Level 2: Primary Tagline

> **Brand protection for the rest of us.**

*Alternatives for A/B testing:*
| Option | Angle | Best For |
|--------|-------|----------|
| "Brand protection for the rest of us" | Populist / anti-enterprise | General audience, landing page |
| "Stop brand impersonators. AI-powered. Starts free." | Feature-forward / action-oriented | Product Hunt, SaaS directories |
| "Enterprise brand protection at startup prices" | Value / price anchoring | Paid ads, comparison pages |
| "Brand protection without the $10K/month price tag" | Specific / pain-driven | SEO, cold outreach |
| "Know who's impersonating your brand. In minutes." | Speed / curiosity | Social media, retargeting |

### Level 3: Supporting Messages (Three Pillars)

Each supporting message maps to a brand pillar and addresses a specific buyer need:

### Level 4: Proof Points & Evidence

Every claim requires evidence. Here's the proof framework:

| Claim | Evidence Type | Specific Proof |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| "Enterprise-grade AI" | Technical | GPT-4o visual similarity analysis; phishing intent detection; composite risk scoring with configurable thresholds |
| "Transparent pricing" | Demonstrable | Pricing page published on website — go look. Competitors: try to find BrandShield's pricing. You can't. |
| "5-minute onboarding" | Experiential | Free tier — try it yourself. Timed signup-to-first-scan: average <5 minutes. |
| "500+ domain variations" | Technical | Typosquatting, homoglyphs, TLD swaps, bitsquatting, keyboard proximity — 500+ permutations per domain |
| "Evidence ready for takedowns" | Tangible | Sample PDF report. Screenshots, WHOIS, DNS, HTML archives — everything a registrar needs. |
| "10-50x cheaper than competitors" | Comparative | BrandShield: $15K-$100K/yr. ZeroFox: $24K-$180K/yr. DoppelDown Enterprise: $5,988/yr. |
| "No sales call required" | Demonstrable | Sign up right now. No "request a demo" button on the site. Self-serve checkout. |

### Level 5: Elevator Pitches (By Duration)

**5-Second (Party / Passing)**
> "We help businesses find out if someone's impersonating their brand online."

**15-Second (Elevator)**
> "DoppelDown is AI-powered brand protection. We detect fake domains, phishing sites, and social media impersonation — and we're the only one in the market with transparent pricing. Starts at free."

**30-Second (Intro Meeting)**
> "Brand impersonation is a massive problem — someone registers a domain that looks like yours, clones your website, and phishes your customers. The tools to detect this exist, but they cost $30K to $300K a year and require sales calls to even learn the price. DoppelDown does the same thing with AI for $0 to $499 a month, self-serve. Sign up and see results in five minutes."

**60-Second (Pitch)**
> "Every business with a brand online is vulnerable to impersonation — fake domains, phishing sites, cloned websites, fake social accounts. The average phishing attack costs $4.7 million, and even for SMBs, a single incident can cost $50K to $500K in customer trust, fraud liability, and cleanup.
>
> The enterprise solutions for this — BrandShield, ZeroFox, Bolster — cost $15K to $300K a year and every single one hides their pricing behind a 'Contact Sales' button.
>
> DoppelDown is the first brand protection platform with transparent pricing, a free tier, and self-serve onboarding. Our AI scans for fake domains, phishing sites, and social impersonation, scores threats by severity, collects evidence automatically, and generates takedown reports. From $0 to $499 a month — pricing right on the website.
>
> Sign up with your email, add your domain, and see threats in under five minutes. We believe every business deserves to know if someone is impersonating their brand. Not just the ones that can afford a six-figure security contract."

## 7. Competitive Differentiation Matrix

### The Head-to-Head Framework

For every competitor type, DoppelDown has a specific differentiation story:

### vs. Enterprise Vendors (BrandShield, ZeroFox, Netcraft, Bolster, Red Points)

| Their Claim | Our Counter | Proof Point |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| "Comprehensive enterprise protection" | "Same AI capabilities, 10-50x less cost, instant access" | Feature comparison showing AI analysis, evidence collection, monitoring at $79-$499 vs. their $15K-$300K |
| "Human analyst teams" | "AI-first means faster detection and fewer human bottlenecks" | Average detection-to-alert time: minutes (DoppelDown) vs. hours/days (human analysts) |
| "Proven track record" | "We prove value in 5 minutes — before you pay anything" | Free tier. Run a scan right now. See your own threats. No sales call needed. |
| "Custom solutions" | "Self-serve means you're protected today, not after a 6-week implementation" | Signup-to-first-scan: <5 minutes. No professional services. No implementation fees. |

**Positioning line:** *"They built brand protection for procurement teams. We built it for people who actually need to protect their brand."*

### vs. Free/Open-Source Tools (dnstwist, urlscan.io, Google Alerts, PhishTank)

| Their Advantage | Our Advantage | Why We Win |
|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| "Free" | "Also free — plus AI analysis, monitoring, alerts, and reports on top" | Free tier matches their price. Paid tiers add what they fundamentally can't do. |
| "Open source" | "Full SaaS — no infrastructure, no CLI, no maintenance" | They require technical setup and ongoing management. We're a URL and a login. |
| "Community-driven" | "AI-driven with automated evidence collection" | Community-reported threats are reactive. Our scanning is proactive. |

**Positioning line:** *"Love dnstwist? So do we. DoppelDown is what happens when you add AI analysis, automated monitoring, evidence collection, and a dashboard on top."*

### vs. DIY (Internal teams, Google Alerts, manual monitoring)

| Their Approach | Why DoppelDown Is Better | ROI Framing |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| "We Google our brand name occasionally" | "DoppelDown scans 500+ domain variations, 8 social platforms, and newly registered domains — automatically" | 10 hours/week of manual monitoring × $75/hr = $3,000/mo. DoppelDown: $79/mo. |
| "We have Google Alerts set up" | "Google Alerts doesn't check domain registrations, visual similarity, or phishing intent" | Google Alerts misses 90%+ of impersonation threats. It's a keyword monitor, not a brand protection tool. |
| "IT handles it when something comes up" | "Reactive = too late. By the time you find out, customers have already been scammed" | Average time from impersonation to discovery without monitoring: 287 days. With DoppelDown: hours. |

**Positioning line:** *"Google Alerts is for monitoring mentions. DoppelDown is for catching impersonators."*

### The Competitive Comparison Page Formula

Every competitor comparison page follows this structure:

```
1. Acknowledge the competitor's strengths (builds credibility)
2. Identify the gap (pricing opacity, enterprise-only, slow onboarding)
3. Show DoppelDown fills the gap (feature comparison table)
4. Provide the "try it yourself" CTA (free tier eliminates risk)
5. Address the "but are you as good?" objection (AI capabilities, evidence quality)
```

---

## 8. Tone, Voice & Personality Guidelines

### Brand Voice: The Knowledgeable Ally

DoppelDown's voice is that of a **knowledgeable friend in cybersecurity** — someone who understands the threat landscape deeply but explains things in plain language, without condescension or jargon. Think: the cybersecurity expert at a dinner party who makes complex threats feel understandable and manageable.

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | What It Sounds Like | What It Doesn't Sound Like |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Direct** | "Your brand has 12 active threats." | "We've identified several potential areas of concern that may warrant further investigation." |
| **Honest** | "Our free tier is limited. If you need daily scanning, you'll want Growth." | "Start free and unlock UNLIMITED potential!" |
| **Confident, not arrogant** | "We built this because the market was broken. Here's how we fixed it." | "We're disrupting the $3.5B brand protection industry with our revolutionary AI platform." |
| **Empathetic** | "We know this is scary. Let's find out what's actually happening." | "Brand impersonation is a critical attack vector requiring immediate remediation." |
| **Specific** | "We scan 500+ domain variations per brand." | "Our comprehensive platform offers robust protection." |
| **Slightly irreverent** | "Every competitor hides their pricing. We put ours on the homepage. Crazy, right?" | "At DoppelDown, we believe in a paradigm of radical pricing transparency." |

### Tone Spectrum by Context

The voice stays consistent; the tone adjusts:

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Landing page** | Confident, clear, energetic | "Brand protection for the rest of us. AI-powered. Self-serve. Starts free." |
| **Blog post** | Authoritative, educational, approachable | "Typosquatting is more common than you think. Here's how to check if your brand is being targeted." |
| **Alert email** | Urgent, clear, helpful | "DoppelDown found 3 new threats targeting your brand. 1 is critical. Review now." |
| **Error/empty state** | Reassuring, slightly warm | "No threats detected yet. That's either great news or we need to scan deeper." |
| **Pricing page** | Transparent, no-BS, confident | "$79/month. That's the price. No sales call needed. No surprise fees." |
| **Social media** | Conversational, slightly provocative | "Go to any brand protection vendor's website. Try to find their pricing. We'll wait." |
| **Support** | Empathetic, solution-oriented, human | "I see the scan stalled — let me look into this and get back to you within 2 hours." |
| **Legal/compliance** | Professional, precise, measured | "DoppelDown collects publicly available data including DNS records and WHOIS information." |

### Language Rules

**Always Use:**
- Plain English
- Active voice ("DoppelDown detects..." not "Threats are detected by...")
- Specific numbers ("500+ domain variations," "$79/month," "5 minutes")
- Customer-centric framing ("your brand," "your customers")
- Action verbs in CTAs ("Scan," "Protect," "Find out," "See")

**Never Use:**
| Banned Phrase | Why | Alternative |
|---------------|-----|-------------|
| "Leverage" | Corporate jargon | "Use" |
| "Solution" (as a noun) | Vague, meaningless | "Platform," "tool," or just name the thing |
| "Cutting-edge" | Every startup says this | Describe what specifically is advanced |
| "Synergize" | Obviously | Never |
| "Democratize" | Overused, pretentious | "Make accessible" or just describe what you mean |
| "Robust" | Means nothing | "Comprehensive" or specific capability |
| "Best-in-class" | Unsubstantiated | Cite specific comparison or metric |
| "End-to-end" | Vague | List the specific stages covered |
| "Seamless" | Every product claims this | "Takes 5 minutes" (be specific) |
| "Enterprise-grade" (in SMB context) | Intimidating | "The same AI used by Fortune 500 companies" |

### Awareness Stage

**Buyer Mindset:** "I don't know if anyone is impersonating my brand" or "Is this actually a risk for a business my size?"

**Goal:** Make the problem feel real, urgent, and relevant to their business size.

| Message Type | Example | Channel |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Problem education | "The average brand has 14 active impersonation threats. Most don't know about any of them." | Blog, LinkedIn, social |
| Fear-of-inaction | "If a customer gets scammed by someone pretending to be you, it's your reputation that suffers." | Blog, email campaigns |
| Trend awareness | "Brand impersonation attacks are up 300% since AI made cloning websites trivially easy." | PR, LinkedIn thought leadership |
| Self-check prompt | "Has anyone ever told you they received a suspicious email 'from' your company?" | Social, ads |
| Statistics | "47% of SMBs have been targeted by brand impersonation but only 3% have monitoring in place." | Infographics, blog posts |

**Primary CTA at this stage:** "Is your brand being impersonated? Find out free →"

---

### Consideration Stage

---

| Success stories | "A brand like yours prevented $200K in customer fraud with DoppelDown monitoring." | Case study emails |

**Primary CTA at this stage:** "Refer a friend — they get 30 days free →"

---

## 10. Content Strategy & Pillar Framework

### Content Mission

> **Be the definitive resource for brand protection knowledge — the place every business turns to when they realize someone might be impersonating them.**

This is a "Wikipedia strategy": own the educational space so thoroughly that Google, social algorithms, and word-of-mouth all funnel people to DoppelDown's content first.

### Why This Works for DoppelDown

The content landscape for SMB brand protection is **almost completely empty**:
- Enterprise vendors publish only for CISOs and security teams
- No one writes practical guides for small business owners
- No one compares pricing (because no one publishes pricing)
- "How to protect my brand from phishing" returns mostly generic cybersecurity advice

DoppelDown can own this entire content space with moderate effort because there's virtually no competition.

### Content Pillars

Four pillars, each mapped to a funnel stage and keyword cluster:

#### Pillar 1: "The Threat" (Awareness)

**Purpose:** Educate buyers that brand impersonation is a real, growing, personal threat to their business.

| Data reports | DoppelDown blog | PR outreach, LinkedIn, Hacker News |
| Case studies | DoppelDown blog | Sales outreach, partner enablement, email drip |
| Founder content | LinkedIn (native) | Cross-post to blog, Indie Hackers, Twitter |

---

## 11. Channel-Specific Messaging

### LinkedIn

**Audience:** Cybersecurity professionals, MSPs, marketing managers, startup founders, small business owners.

**Content Strategy:**
| Post Type | Frequency | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Thought leadership (brand protection insights) | 2x/week | "Go to any brand protection vendor's website. Try to find their pricing. I'll wait." |
| Founder journey updates | 1x/week | "Week 4 of building DoppelDown in public. Here's what 100 users taught us." |
| Data/statistics | 1x/week | "We scanned 500 brands this week. Average threats found per brand: 14. The scariest: 47." |
| Product updates | 1x/2 weeks | "New feature: DoppelDown now monitors all 8 social media platforms." |
| Engagement bait (good kind) | 1x/week | "What's the worst brand impersonation you've ever seen? I'll go first." |

**Tone:** Professional but direct. First-person. Slightly provocative about the industry. Never corporate.

**Formatting Rules:**
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Line breaks between paragraphs
- Hook in the first line (must work before "see more")
- Hashtags in the first comment, not the post
- One image or no image — never a generic stock photo

---

### Reddit

**Audience:** r/smallbusiness, r/cybersecurity, r/msp, r/startups, r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur

**Content Strategy:**
| Subreddit | Approach | Example Post Title |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| r/smallbusiness | Helpful advice, tool mentioned naturally | "PSA: Check if someone registered a domain similar to yours — here's how" |
| r/cybersecurity | Technical depth, peer-level discussion | "Built an AI-powered brand impersonation scanner — feedback welcome" |
| r/msp | Channel/partner angle, revenue focus | "Adding brand protection to your MSP stack — what's working for you?" |
| r/startups | Founder journey, building in public | "I spent 6 months building a brand protection SaaS. Here's what I'd do differently." |
| r/SaaS | Product/business discussion | "We launched with transparent pricing in a market where everyone hides theirs. Results so far." |

**Tone:** Authentic, conversational, never promotional. Reddit destroys overt marketing. Lead with value, mention DoppelDown only when naturally relevant or when asked.

**Rules:**
- Read each subreddit's rules before posting
- Be a genuine community member, not a drive-by marketer
- Answer questions in comments without plugging the product
- When you do mention DoppelDown, be transparent: "Full disclosure, I built this"

---

### Email (Cold Outreach)

**Audience:** Small business owners, marketing managers, MSP owners identified through LinkedIn research.

**Subject Line Formulas:**
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Curiosity + specificity | "3 domains targeting [their brand] — did you know?" |
| Peer reference | "Other [industry] businesses are dealing with this too" |
| Question | "Is anyone monitoring [their domain] for impersonation?" |
| Direct value | "Free brand protection scan for [their company]" |

**Email Framework (3-sentence cold email):**
```
Line 1: Observation about their specific situation
Line 2: The problem it creates
Line 3: The offer (free scan, no pitch)

Example:
"I noticed [brand].com has 4 registered domain variations that don't belong to you —
including [brand]-login.com, which is a classic phishing setup.

I built a tool that scans for this automatically. Happy to run a free scan
if you want to see the full picture — no strings."
```

---

### Product Hunt

**Messaging Priorities:**
1. Lead with the market gap (pricing opacity)
2. Emphasize the free tier and self-serve onboarding
3. Richard's founder story creates emotional connection
4. Engage with every single comment personally

**Tagline:** "Brand protection that doesn't require a sales call" (52 chars)

**Key Messages for PH Audience:**
- "We put pricing on the website. In a market where nobody does."
- "Sign up and scan in 5 minutes. No demo. No sales call."
- "Built by a cybersecurity professional who got tired of watching SMBs get ignored."
- "Free tier. Real AI. No catch."

---

### Google Ads (Future)

**Campaign Structure:**
| Campaign | Keywords | Message | Landing Page |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Competitor | "[competitor] pricing," "[competitor] alternative" | "Looking for brand protection pricing? Here it is: $0-$499/mo. No sales call." | Comparison page |
| Problem-aware | "someone copied my website," "fake domain my brand" | "Find out who's impersonating your brand. Free scan. Results in 5 minutes." | Landing page |
| Solution-aware | "brand protection tool," "brand monitoring software" | "AI-powered brand protection. Transparent pricing. Starts free." | Pricing page |
| Retargeting | Visitors who didn't sign up | "You checked — now scan. Free brand protection scan in 5 minutes." | Signup page |

---

## 12. Objection Handling Playbook

Every objection is a signal of interest. Here's how to handle each one:

### Price Objections

| Objection | Response | Reframe |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| "Why is it so much cheaper? Is it worse?" | "We're AI-first with self-serve onboarding. No enterprise sales team eating 40% of margins, no 6-month implementations. Same AI technology, different business model." | Quality isn't defined by price — it's defined by results. Run a free scan and see. |
| "$79/month is still a lot for my business" | "A single phishing attack targeting your brand can cost $50K–$500K in customer trust and fraud. $79/month is insurance." | Frame as cost of prevention vs. cost of incident. |
| "I can do this manually for free" | "You absolutely can. But manually monitoring 500+ domain variations, 8 social platforms, and newly registered domains takes 10+ hours/week. At $75/hour, that's $3,000/month." | Time is money. Automation saves both. |

### Trust Objections

| Objection | Response | Reframe |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| "I've never heard of DoppelDown" | "We're new — and that's the point. The incumbents have been overcharging for years. Try the free tier: zero risk, zero commitment." | Being new is a feature when the old players are broken. |
| "How do I know the AI is accurate?" | "Every finding includes evidence: screenshots, WHOIS data, DNS records. You verify it yourself. No black box." | We show our work. You decide what's real. |
| "What if you shut down?" | "We're bootstrapped and profitable from customer revenue. No VC runway to burn through. And your data is exportable anytime." | Sustainable business model = longevity. |

### Need Objections

| Objection | Response | Reframe |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| "Is this really a problem for a business my size?" | "Smaller businesses are actually MORE targeted because they're less likely to have monitoring. Run a free scan — you might be surprised." | The scan is the proof. Let the product answer. |
| "I already have Google Alerts" | "Google Alerts monitors keyword mentions. It doesn't check domain registrations, visual similarity, phishing intent, or social media impersonation. They're complementary, not competing." | Google Alerts is a kitchen smoke alarm. DoppelDown is a security system. |
| "My IT person handles this" | "Do they scan 500+ domain variations daily? Check 8 social platforms? Collect forensic evidence automatically? This is a specialized tool, not a general IT task." | Even great IT teams can't do this manually at scale. |

### Timing Objections

| Objection | Response | Reframe |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| "Not a priority right now" | "That's what every business says until a customer tells them they got phished. The free tier takes 5 minutes to set up — then it runs on autopilot." | 5 minutes now prevents a crisis later. |
| "I'll look at this next quarter" | "Totally understand. In the meantime, here's a free scan — at least know what's out there so you can make an informed decision when the time comes." | Give value now. The scan creates urgency naturally. |
| "We're evaluating other tools too" | "Great — you should. Check our comparison pages: we show pricing, features, and onboarding side-by-side with BrandShield, ZeroFox, Bolster, and the rest. We're the only one that does." | Transparency about competitors builds trust. |

---

## 13. Brand Language System

### Power Words (Use Frequently)

These words reinforce DoppelDown's positioning:

| Word | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Transparent** | Direct attack on competitor opacity |
| **Instant** | Contrasts with weeks-long enterprise onboarding |
| **Impersonator** / **Impostor** | Makes the threat feel personal and villainous |
| **Evidence** | Implies rigor, trustworthiness, actionability |
| **Alert** | Creates sense of active protection |
| **Protect** / **Protection** | Emotionally resonant — people protect what they love |
| **Free** | The single most powerful word in marketing |
| **Minutes** (as in "results in minutes") | Speed is the tangible differentiator |
| **Your brand** | Personalization; makes it about them, not us |

### About DoppelDown

DoppelDown is an AI-powered brand protection platform that detects fake domains, phishing sites, and social media impersonation targeting businesses. Founded by cybersecurity professional Richard Dobson, DoppelDown is the first brand protection tool with transparent, published pricing and self-serve onboarding — making brand protection accessible to businesses of all sizes.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Only brand protection platform with pricing on the website** ($0-$499/month)
2. **Self-serve onboarding** — sign up to first scan in under 5 minutes
3. **Free tier** — no competitor offers free brand monitoring
4. **AI-powered threat analysis** — visual similarity, phishing intent, risk scoring
5. **Evidence collection** — automated screenshots, WHOIS, DNS, HTML archives

### Target Audience
Small and mid-size businesses, startups, digital marketing agencies, and managed security providers (MSPs/MSSPs) who need brand protection without enterprise budgets.

### The Market Gap
Every major brand protection vendor (BrandShield, ZeroFox, Bolster, Red Points, Netcraft) charges $15,000–$300,000+ per year and requires a sales call. DoppelDown serves the millions of businesses those vendors can't or won't.

### Founder Quote
> "Brand impersonation doesn't discriminate by company size. Protection shouldn't either."
> — Richard Dobson, Founder, DoppelDown

### Boilerplate
DoppelDown is an AI-powered brand protection platform that helps businesses detect and respond to brand impersonation, including typosquatting domains, phishing sites, and fake social media accounts. With transparent pricing starting at $0/month and self-serve onboarding, DoppelDown makes enterprise-grade brand protection accessible to businesses of all sizes. Learn more at doppeldown.com.
