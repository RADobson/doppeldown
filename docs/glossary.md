# Glossary

Key terms and concepts used throughout DoppelDown.

---

### Brand
A domain and its associated social media handles that you want DoppelDown to monitor and protect. Each brand is an independent monitoring unit with its own threat history, scan schedule, and alert configuration.

### Battle Card
A one-page competitive comparison document used by sales to quickly differentiate DoppelDown from a specific competitor.

### Brand Impersonation
The act of creating domains, websites, or social media accounts that mimic a legitimate brand to deceive users. DoppelDown detects three main types: typosquatting, phishing pages, and fake social accounts.

### CRON_SECRET
A shared secret used to authenticate scheduled cron job requests (automated scans, digests, NRD checks). Set in environment variables and passed as an `Authorization` header.

### Domain Variation
An alternative version of a brand's domain generated by DoppelDown's detection engine. Variations include typos, homoglyphs, TLD swaps, and common misspellings. The number of variations checked depends on the subscription tier.

### Evidence
Proof collected by DoppelDown to document a detected threat. Evidence types include:
- **Screenshots** — Visual capture of the threatening page
- **WHOIS data** — Domain registration information
- **HTML snapshots** — Archived page source code

### Evidence Bucket
A Supabase Storage bucket (`evidence` by default) where screenshot and HTML evidence files are stored. Can be public or private (with signed URLs).

### Full Scan
A scan that checks all detection vectors: domain typosquats, web phishing pages, and social media fake accounts. Compare with *domain-only scan* and *social-only scan*.

### Homoglyph
A character that visually resembles another character. Attackers use homoglyphs to create deceptive domain names (e.g., using Cyrillic `а` instead of Latin `a`, or `rn` instead of `m`). DoppelDown's domain generator checks hundreds of homoglyph substitutions.

### Logo Scanner
DoppelDown's reverse image search feature that finds unauthorized uses of a brand's logo across the web using Google Vision API or SerpAPI Google Lens.

### NRD (Newly Registered Domain)
A domain registered within the last 30 days. Enterprise-tier customers get NRD monitoring to catch brand-infringing domains as soon as they're registered, before they're used for phishing.

### Phishing Page
A web page designed to trick users into entering credentials or personal information by impersonating a legitimate brand's website. DoppelDown detects phishing pages through web scanning and visual similarity analysis.

### Rate Limit
The maximum number of API requests allowed per time window, based on subscription tier:
- **Free:** 60 requests/minute
- **Starter:** 120 requests/minute
- **Professional:** 300 requests/minute
- **Enterprise:** Unlimited

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
A Supabase/PostgreSQL feature that ensures users can only access their own data. DoppelDown enforces RLS on all tables so users never see other users' brands, threats, or scans.

### Scan
An automated check performed by DoppelDown across domains, web pages, and social media platforms to detect threats against a registered brand. Scans can be triggered manually or run automatically on a schedule based on tier.

### Scan Worker
A background process that executes scan jobs. Runs as a separate service (via PM2 on a VPS or as a Docker container) with Chromium for screenshot capture.

### Signed URL
A temporary, authenticated URL that grants time-limited access to private evidence files stored in Supabase Storage. Default TTL is 1 hour.

### Social Scanner
DoppelDown's module that searches social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, Telegram, Discord) for accounts impersonating a brand.

### Takedown Report
A formatted document containing evidence of brand impersonation, designed to be submitted to domain registrars, hosting providers, or social media platforms to request removal. Available in HTML, text, CSV, and JSON formats.

### Threat
A detected instance of brand impersonation. Each threat includes:
- **Type** — Domain typosquat, phishing page, or fake social account
- **Severity** — Risk score based on multiple factors
- **Evidence** — Screenshots, WHOIS data, HTML snapshots
- **Status** — Active, resolved, or dismissed

### Threat Fusion
DoppelDown's intelligence correlation engine that combines signals from domain, web, and social scanning to produce a unified threat assessment with confidence scoring.

### Threat Score
A numeric severity rating (0-100) assigned to each detected threat based on factors like domain similarity, content match, SSL presence, registration recency, and AI visual analysis.

### Tier
A subscription plan that determines feature access and usage limits. DoppelDown offers four tiers: Free ($0), Starter ($49/mo), Professional ($99/mo), and Enterprise ($249/mo).

### Typosquatting
The practice of registering domain names that are misspellings or close variations of a legitimate brand's domain, often used for phishing or traffic interception. Examples for `acme.com`:
- `acm3.com` (character substitution)
- `acmee.com` (repeated character)
- `acme.net` (TLD swap)
- `acme-corp.com` (hyphenation)

### Visual Similarity Analysis
AI-powered comparison (via OpenAI Vision) between a brand's legitimate website and a suspected phishing page. Produces a similarity score to help determine if a page is impersonating the brand.

### Web Scanner
DoppelDown's module that searches the web for pages that visually or textually impersonate a brand, using search engine results and AI analysis.

### Webhook
An HTTP callback that DoppelDown sends to your specified URL when events occur (new threats detected, scans completed, etc.). See the [Webhooks guide](./WEBHOOKS.md).
