## 1. Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

DoppelDown is positioned in the **Digital Risk Protection (DRP)** market — a $7.3B market growing at ~20% CAGR to $15B by 2029. Every incumbent (ZeroFox, BrandShield, Netcraft, Bolster) charges $2K–$15K/month with opaque "contact sales" pricing. DoppelDown is **the first self-serve, transparent-pricing, AI-native brand protection platform** accessible to the 30M+ SMBs globally that currently have zero protection.

### Fundraising Recommendation

| Decision Point | Recommendation |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Should you raise?** | Not yet — bootstrap to $10K+ MRR first (see §3) |
| **When to start fundraising** | When you hit $10K–$25K MRR with clear growth trajectory |
| **Target round** | Pre-Seed ($500K–$1.5M) or Seed ($1.5M–$4M) |
| **Optimal timeline** | Begin prep now, raise Q3–Q4 2026 (6–8 months) |
| **Valuation target** | Pre-Seed: $3M–$6M pre-money / Seed: $8M–$15M pre-money |
| **Use of funds** | Engineering (50%), GTM (30%), Ops (20%) |

### Why Wait?

Raising too early means:
- **Maximum dilution** — you give away the most equity when you have the least leverage
- **Weak negotiating position** — pre-revenue = investor-friendly terms, not founder-friendly
- **Distraction** — fundraising is a 3–6 month full-time job that kills product momentum
- **Lower valuation** — $0 ARR cybersecurity SaaS in Australia ≈ $2M–$4M pre-money. With $10K MRR, the same company ≈ $8M–$15M pre-money

**The best fundraising strategy is building a product people pay for.** Every dollar of MRR is worth 10x in fundraising leverage.

## 2. Fundraising Thesis

### Why Investors Should Care About DoppelDown

**Thesis in one sentence:**
> "DoppelDown is doing for brand protection what Canva did for design — democratizing a capability previously locked behind enterprise sales teams and six-figure contracts."

### Investment Thesis Framework

```
MARKET TIMING:
├── AI-generated phishing up 300%+ since 2024
├── Regulatory mandates (DORA, NIS2, SEC rules) forcing brand monitoring
├── 30M+ SMBs globally with ZERO brand protection
└── Incumbents all require sales calls and 5-figure contracts

PRODUCT WEDGE:
├── Self-serve signup (no sales call)
├── Transparent pricing ($79–$499/mo vs. $2K–$15K/mo)
├── AI-native architecture (not bolt-on AI)
├── PLG motion (free tier → paid conversion)
└── Domain + social + email infra detection in one platform

BUSINESS MODEL:
├── SaaS with strong unit economics potential
├── Low marginal cost per customer (AI inference = pennies)
├── Natural expansion revenue (more brands → higher tier)
├── Net revenue retention potential >120% at scale
└── CAC payback <6 months via PLG

MARKET SIZE:
├── TAM: $15B+ (global DRP market by 2029)
├── SAM: $3B+ (SMB + mid-market brand protection)
├── SOM: $50M+ (English-speaking SMBs, first 5 years)
└── Land-and-expand into enterprise via bottom-up adoption
```

### Competitive Moat (for investors)

| Moat Type | DoppelDown's Position |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Distribution moat** | PLG + transparent pricing = viral loops incumbents can't replicate |
| **Data moat** | Every scan builds a threat intelligence dataset; more customers = better AI models |
| **Switching costs** | Historical threat data, configured alerts, team workflows |
| **Speed moat** | Small team, AI-native stack, no legacy to maintain |
| **Positioning moat** | "Brand protection for everyone" — incumbents can't go down-market without cannibalizing |

## 3. Stage Assessment: Where DoppelDown Is Today

### Honest Current State

| Dimension | Status | Fundraising Impact |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Product** | MVP built, onboarding works, core scanning functional | ✅ Demoable |
| **Revenue** | Pre-revenue / early customers | ⚠️ Weakest point for fundraising |
| **Team** | Solo founder + AI co-pilot | ⚠️ Investors want teams (but solo founders do raise) |
| **Market validation** | Pricing strategy done, competitive analysis strong | ✅ Good preparation |
| **Technical architecture** | Job queue, worker, AI pipeline designed | ✅ Solid foundation |
| **Location** | Sunshine Coast, Australia | ⚠️ Not a VC hub (but remote-friendly era) |

### What You Need Before Raising

#### Tier 1: Must-Have (Non-Negotiable)

- [ ] **Revenue traction** — $5K+ MRR minimum, $10K+ MRR ideal
  - Even 20–30 paying customers at $79–$199/mo = $1.5K–$6K MRR
  - Shows product-market fit signal
- [ ] **Month-over-month growth** — 15–30% MoM revenue growth for 3+ months
  - Investors care about growth rate more than absolute numbers at seed stage
- [ ] **5–10 customer testimonials or case studies**
  - "We found 47 typosquat domains targeting our brand within 24 hours"
  - Social proof is everything at early stage
- [ ] **Clean cap table** — solo founder = clean, but document any IP assignments, advisor agreements
- [ ] **Basic metrics dashboard** — MRR, churn, CAC, activation rate, scan volume

#### Tier 2: Strongly Recommended

- [ ] **A co-founder or key hire** — especially a technical co-founder or head of engineering
  - Solo founder raises are possible but harder; VCs want bus-factor >1
  - Even a committed advisor with equity can help
- [ ] **1–2 design partners** (companies who will give feedback and reference calls)
- [ ] **Competitive win stories** — "Customer X evaluated ZeroFox at $5K/mo and chose us at $199/mo"
- [ ] **Data room prepared** (see §11)
- [ ] **Pitch deck polished** (see §4)

#### Tier 3: Nice-to-Have

- [ ] ProductHunt launch with strong results
- [ ] Press coverage or analyst mentions
- [ ] SOC 2 Type I (or clear roadmap to it)
- [ ] API customers / partner integrations
- [ ] Advisory board with cybersecurity credibility

## 4. Pitch Deck Outline (14 Slides)

### Slide-by-Slide Blueprint

Each slide includes: purpose, key message, supporting data, and design notes.

---

#### Slide 1: TITLE
**Purpose:** First impression, brand identity

```
DoppelDown
━━━━━━━━━
AI-Powered Brand Protection for Everyone

[Logo]
[Tagline]: "Stop brand impersonators before they strike"
[Your name, title, contact]
[Date]
```

**Design:** Clean, dark background (security feel), logo prominent. No clutter.

---

#### Slide 2: THE PROBLEM
**Purpose:** Establish urgency and pain

**Key message:** Brand impersonation is exploding, and 99% of businesses have zero protection.

**Content:**
- AI-generated phishing attacks up 300%+ since 2024
- Average phishing attack costs $4.76M (IBM 2025)
- 83% of organizations experienced a phishing attack in the past year
- **But:** Brand protection tools cost $2,000–$15,000/month and require sales calls
- Result: Only Fortune 500 can afford protection. Everyone else is a sitting duck.

**Visual:** Split screen — "Enterprise tools" (opaque pricing, sales calls, 6-week onboarding) vs. "Everyone else" (nothing, hope, prayer)

---

#### Slide 3: THE CONSEQUENCES
**Purpose:** Deepen the emotional resonance of the problem

**Content:**
- Real examples of brand impersonation attacks (anonymized or public)
- Customer story: "[Brand X] discovered 47 lookalike domains, 3 with active phishing pages, targeting their customers"
- Financial impact: Revenue loss, customer trust erosion, legal liability, regulatory fines
- Timeline: From domain registration to active phishing = often <48 hours

**Visual:** Screenshot of actual DoppelDown threat detection (demo data)

---

#### Slide 4: THE SOLUTION
**Purpose:** Introduce DoppelDown

- Screenshot 3: Evidence package / takedown report

**Design:** Clean product shots, annotations highlighting key features

---

#### Slide 6: HOW IT WORKS (TECHNOLOGY)
**Purpose:** Establish technical credibility

**Content:**
```
Brand Onboarding → Domain Generation → Active Scanning → AI Analysis → Alert & Report
     (2 min)        (100s of variants)   (WHOIS, DNS,     (Risk scoring,  (Email, webhook,
                                          screenshots)      visual AI,     PDF reports)
                                                           phishing intent)
```

**Key differentiators:**
- AI-native: models trained on phishing patterns, not rule-based
- Multi-vector: domain + social + email infra (O365 detection)
- Evidence-grade: legal-ready reports with screenshots, WHOIS, DNS records
- Scalable: job queue architecture handles thousands of concurrent scans

---

### Fundraising Calendar Tactics

| Timing | Quality | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Jan–Mar** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | VCs have fresh allocations, high energy |
| **Apr–May** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Still active, before summer slowdown |
| **Jun–Aug** | ⭐⭐ | Summer doldrums, partners on vacation |
| **Sep–Oct** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Best time — Q4 deployment pressure |
| **Nov–Dec** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Slows after Thanksgiving (US), some year-end deals |

**Recommendation:** Target Aug–Oct 2026 for active fundraise — Sep/Oct is the strongest window and gives you maximum time to build traction.

| **Bessemer Venture Partners** | Seed–B | $1–$10M | Cloud/SaaS thesis, cybersecurity interest |
| **Point Nine Capital** | Seed | $500K–$3M | European but global, deep SaaS expertise |
| **Uncork Capital** | Seed | $1–$3M | Early SaaS specialist |

### Tier 4: Angel Investors & Syndicates

**Critical for pre-seed/seed.** Angels move faster, write smaller checks, and can introduce you to VCs.

| Type | Target Profile | How to Find |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **CISO Angels** | Current/former CISOs who angel invest | LinkedIn, BSides conferences, CISO communities |
| **Cybersecurity Founders** | Founders of cyber startups who've exited | Crunchbase, AngelList, warm intros |
| **Aussie Angel Networks** | Sydney Angels, Melbourne Angels, QLD angel groups | Direct application |
| **AngelList Syndicates** | Cyber-focused syndicates | AngelList platform |
| **SaaStr Angels** | SaaS operators who angel invest | SaaStr community |

**Specific Angel Targets (roles, not names — research to identify):**

- CISOs at Australian banks/telcos (CBA, NAB, Telstra, Optus)
- Former executives at CrowdStrike, Proofpoint, Netskope (Richard's industry connections!)
- Australian cybersecurity entrepreneurs (e.g., founders of Bugcrowd, UpGuard, Kasada)
- Security engineers turned angel investors
- Richard's own professional network (cybersecurity presales → CISO contacts)

### Tier 5: Strategic Investors

Companies that might invest and also become partners/customers.

| Company | Why | Risk |
|---------|-----|------|
| **Domain registrars** (GoDaddy Ventures, Namecheap) | Natural distribution partner | May compete |
| **Web hosting** (Cloudflare, Automattic) | Complementary security offering | Low conflict |
| **Email security** (Proofpoint, Abnormal) | Brand protection → email security pipeline | Richard's industry |
| **Cyber insurance** | Brand monitoring data → underwriting insights | Very aligned |

## 8. Term Sheet Playbook

### Understanding the Instruments

#### SAFE Notes (Pre-Seed / Very Early Seed)

**What:** Simple Agreement for Future Equity. Not debt, not equity — a promise of future shares.

**When to use:** Pre-revenue to very early revenue. Quick, cheap, minimal negotiation.

| Term | Founder-Friendly | Standard | Investor-Friendly |
|------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Valuation Cap** | $6M+ | $4M–$6M | <$4M |
| **Discount** | 0% (cap only) | 15–20% | 25%+ |
| **Pro-rata rights** | No | Yes (>$50K) | Yes (any amount) |
| **MFN clause** | Acceptable | Standard | — |
| **Type** | Post-money SAFE | Post-money SAFE | Pre-money SAFE |

**DoppelDown recommendation:**
- Use **YC post-money SAFE** (most standard, well-understood)
- Target **$5M–$6M valuation cap** for pre-seed
- **No discount** if cap is reasonable
- Grant **pro-rata rights** to investors writing $100K+ checks
- Keep it simple — one page, minimal negotiation

#### Priced Equity Round (Seed / Series A)

**When to use:** When raising $1.5M+ and/or you have meaningful traction.

| Term | What It Means | Founder-Friendly | Watch Out For |
|------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Pre-money valuation** | Company value before investment | Higher = less dilution | Don't overoptimize — a fair valuation with great investors > maximum valuation with bad ones |
| **Liquidation preference** | Who gets paid first in exit | 1x non-participating | >1x participating = BAD |
| **Anti-dilution** | Protection if next round is lower | Broad-based weighted average | Full ratchet = very bad |
| **Board seats** | Control over company decisions | Founder majority (2-1) | Investor majority = loss of control |
| **Protective provisions** | Veto rights on major decisions | Standard set only | Excessive provisions = handcuffs |
| **Vesting** | Founder share vesting | 4yr / 1yr cliff, credit for time worked | Vesting reset = unfair for existing founders |
| **Option pool** | Shares reserved for future hires | 10–15% | 20%+ option pool = hidden dilution |
| **Pro-rata rights** | Right to invest in future rounds | Major investors only | Universal pro-rata = crowded cap table |
| **Information rights** | Investor access to financials | Quarterly updates | Monthly board packages = admin burden |
| **Drag-along** | Forcing minority to sell | Standard at high thresholds | Low threshold = forced exit risk |
| **Right of first refusal** | Approval for secondary sales | Standard | Overly broad = limits your options |

### Critical Term Sheet Red Flags 🚩

| Red Flag | Why It's Bad | What To Do |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **>1x liquidation preference** | In anything less than a huge exit, investors get paid and you don't | Walk away or negotiate to 1x non-participating |
| **Full ratchet anti-dilution** | If you raise a down round, early investors get massively more shares at your expense | Insist on broad-based weighted average |
| **Participating preferred** | Investors get their money back AND their pro-rata share — double dipping | Negotiate to non-participating (standard for seed) |
| **Investor board majority** | You lose control of your own company | Founder majority is non-negotiable at seed |
| **Excessive option pool** (>15%) | Dilutes founders before investors' ownership is calculated | Push back to 10–12% or justify specific hiring plan |
| **Vesting reset** | Your existing years of work don't count | Insist on credit for time already invested |
| **Redemption rights** | Investors can force you to buy back shares | Unusual and toxic at seed stage |
| **Cumulative dividends** | Increases liquidation preference over time | Not standard at seed, reject it |

### Negotiation Framework

```
BEFORE NEGOTIATION:
1. Get 2+ term sheets (creates leverage)
2. Hire a startup lawyer (CRITICAL — $5K–$15K well spent)
3. Know your BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)
4. Understand that VALUATION is not the only important term

DURING NEGOTIATION:
1. Lead with partnership language: "How do we build something amazing together?"
2. Be transparent about other offers (without specifics)
3. Focus on: valuation, liq pref, board control, option pool, anti-dilution
4. Don't negotiate over email — calls/meetings build relationship
5. Let your lawyer handle the markup — you handle the relationship

RED LINES (walk away if these aren't met):
□ Founder board majority
□ 1x non-participating preferred (or better)
□ Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution
□ No vesting reset (credit for time served)
□ Standard protective provisions only
```

### Recommended Legal Counsel (Australia)

| Firm | Speciality | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Gilbert + Tobin** | Venture capital, tech startups | Top-tier Aus startup law firm |
| **King & Wood Mallesons** | Corporate, VC | Large firm with startup practice |
| **Lander & Rogers** | Startup-friendly | Mid-tier with good startup rates |
| **Sprintlaw** | Online startup legal | Budget-friendly for early stage |
| **LegalVision** | Startup legal, fixed fees | Australian, good for early stage |

**For US investors:** Consider engaging a US firm familiar with Australian structures — e.g., Cooley, Gunderson, Wilson Sonsini (all standard Silicon Valley startup firms). Your Australian lawyer can coordinate.

## 9. Founder-Investor Relationship Management

### The Investor Relationship Lifecycle

```
STAGES:
1. AWARENESS    → Investor knows you exist
2. INTEREST     → They're tracking your progress
3. EVALUATION   → Active due diligence
4. COMMITMENT   → Term sheet and closing
5. PARTNERSHIP  → Post-investment relationship
6. AMPLIFICATION → They actively help grow the company
```

### Pre-Investment: Building Warm Relationships (Do This NOW)

The #1 mistake founders make: reaching out to investors only when they need money.

**Start building relationships 6–12 months before you need to raise:**

1. **Monthly investor update emails** (even before they invest)
   - Send to 20–30 target investors monthly
   - Format: 3 bullet wins, 1 bullet ask, key metrics
   - This is the single most powerful fundraising tool

   ```
   Subject: DoppelDown Monthly Update — [Month] 2026

   Hi [Name],

   Quick update on DoppelDown (AI-powered brand protection):

   📈 WINS
   • MRR hit $[X]K (up [Y]% MoM)
   • [Z] new customers including [notable logo]
   • Launched [feature] — already [result]

   🔢 METRICS
   • MRR: $[X]K | Customers: [Y] | Growth: [Z]% MoM

   🙏 ASK
   • Looking for intros to [specific person/company]

   Best,
   Richard
   ```

2. **Share threat intelligence reports** with investor targets
   - "We detected X thousand brand impersonation attempts this month — here's what we learned"
   - Positions you as a domain expert, not just a fundraiser

3. **Engage on social media**
   - Comment on their portfolio company announcements
   - Share relevant cybersecurity news/insights
   - Be visible in their ecosystem

4. **Attend events** (virtual and in-person)
   - SaaStr Annual (if applicable)
   - Australian startup events (SouthStart, StartCon)
   - Cybersecurity conferences (BSides, AusCERT)
   - Pitch competitions (practice + visibility)

### The "Warm Intro" Machine

Cold emails to VCs have a <2% response rate. Warm intros have a 30–50% response rate.

**How to get warm intros:**

| Source | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| **Portfolio founders** | Find companies in target VC's portfolio. Reach out to their founders. Build genuine relationship. Ask for intro. |
| **Angel investors** | Angels who invest $25K in your pre-seed often know VC partners personally |
| **Industry contacts** | Richard's cybersecurity network (CrowdStrike, Proofpoint contacts) → many know VCs |
| **LinkedIn** | Map your 2nd-degree connections to target investors |
| **Accelerators** | Y Combinator, Techstars, Startmate (Aus) → instant investor access |
| **Other founders** | Founders who recently raised from your target VCs are the best intro source |

### Post-Investment: Being a Great Portfolio Company

| Cadence | Action | Detail |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Monthly** | Investor update email | Wins, metrics, asks, lowlights (be honest) |
| **Quarterly** | Board meeting (if applicable) | Deck + financials + strategic discussion |
| **Ad-hoc** | Big news / crisis | Don't surprise investors — tell them first |
| **Annually** | Retrospective + plan | Review year, share next year plan |

**The Golden Rules of Investor Communication:**

1. **Never surprise your investors.** Bad news should come from you, not the grapevine.
2. **Be honest about challenges.** Investors respect founders who face problems head-on.
3. **Make specific asks.** "Can you intro me to the CISO at [Company]?" > "Can you help with BD?"
4. **Report metrics consistently.** Same format, same metrics, every month. Let them see the trend.
5. **Treat updates as accountability.** The monthly update forces you to reflect on progress.
6. **Share lowlights, not just highlights.** "We missed our MRR target by 15% because [reason]. Here's what we're doing about it."
7. **Respect their time.** Investors have 20+ portfolio companies. Be concise. Be organized.

### Leveraging Investors for Value (Beyond Money)

| Value-Add | How to Activate |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Customer intros** | "Can you connect me with the security team at [portfolio company]?" |
| **Hiring** | "We're looking for a senior engineer. Can you share in your network?" |
| **Strategic advice** | "We're choosing between PLG-only and adding outbound sales. What have you seen work?" |
| **Follow-on funding** | "We're starting to plan our Series A. Who should we be talking to?" |
| **PR / visibility** | "Would you be open to co-authoring a blog post on brand protection trends?" |
| **Governance** | "Can you recommend a good independent board member?" |

## 10. Alternative Funding Paths

### Should You Raise VC at All?

Before committing to the VC path, consider:

| Path | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|------|------|------|----------|
| **Bootstrapping** | Full ownership, full control, no dilution | Slower growth, limited resources | If lifestyle business is the goal |
| **Revenue-based financing** | No dilution, repay from revenue | Requires existing revenue, expensive | $10K+ MRR, want to accelerate |
| **Government grants** | Free money, no dilution | Slow, bureaucratic, reporting burden | Australian grants are generous |
| **Angel round** | Faster, less formal, mentor network | Smaller amounts, cap table complexity | Very early stage |
| **Accelerator** | Network, mentorship, credibility, small check | Dilution (6–10%), time commitment | Pre-traction stage |
| **VC Seed** | Large check, strong network, credibility | Dilution, board oversight, growth pressure | If hyper-growth is the goal |

### Australian Government Grants (FREE MONEY!)

Australia has some of the most generous startup grants in the world. These are **non-dilutive** (no equity given up).

| Grant | Amount | Eligibility | Notes |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| **R&D Tax Incentive** | 43.5% refundable offset | Australian company, <$20M revenue | Huge for AI/ML R&D spend |
| **Entrepreneurs' Programme** | Up to $1M | Australian SME | Business growth + innovation |
| **Advance Queensland** | $25K–$250K | Queensland-based | Richard's backyard! |
| **Cyber Security CRC** | Varies | Cybersecurity R&D | Perfect fit for DoppelDown |
| **Export Market Development Grant** | Up to $150K | Exporting Australian company | When selling to US/UK customers |
| **AusIndustry Accelerating Commercialisation** | Up to $1M | Matched funding | For commercializing research |

**Recommendation:** Apply for the R&D Tax Incentive immediately. DoppelDown's AI development work likely qualifies for a 43.5% cash refund on eligible R&D expenditure. This is massive.

### Accelerator Programs

| Program | Location | Check | Equity | Why DoppelDown Fits |
|---------|----------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| **Startmate** | Australia | $120K | 7.5% | Best Aus accelerator, cybersecurity companies in portfolio |
| **Y Combinator** | US (remote ok) | $500K | 7% | Ultimate credibility stamp, massive investor network |
| **Techstars** | Various | $120K | 6% | Multiple cyber-focused cohorts |
| **MACH37** | US | $75K | 7.5% | Cybersecurity-only accelerator |
| **CyLon** | UK | $25K | 6% | Cybersecurity-focused |

**Recommendation:** Apply to **Startmate** (Australian, aligned) and **YC** (swing for the fences). YC acceptance would 10x your fundraising prospects overnight.

### Revenue-Based Financing

Once DoppelDown hits $10K+ MRR:

| Provider | Terms | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Pipe** | Advance future annual contracts | Good for converting annual subscriptions to upfront cash |
| **Capchase** | Revenue-based advance | SaaS-focused, fast |
| **Lighter Capital** | Revenue-based loan | Non-dilutive, flexible |
| **Clearco** | Revenue share | Less ideal for SaaS |

## 12. Risk Matrix & Mitigation

### Risks Investors Will Ask About

| Risk | Severity | Investor Concern | Your Response |
|------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Solo founder** | 🔴 High | Bus factor, can one person do it all? | "Building with AI-augmented development. First hire will be [role]. My cybersecurity background means I am the domain expert AND the builder." |
| **Pre-revenue** | 🔴 High | Is there real demand? | "Pricing research shows 10–20x underpricing vs. market. [X] customers on waitlist. Enterprise competitors validate the market — we make it accessible." |
| **Australia-based** | 🟡 Medium | Far from Silicon Valley, small local market | "Global product from day one. SaaS doesn't need physical proximity. Australia has generous R&D tax incentives (43.5% cash back). Timezone advantage for Asian markets." |
| **Technical scraping fragility** | 🟡 Medium | Will the product keep working? | "Transitioning to API-based and AI-native detection. Worker architecture designed for resilience. Multiple detection vectors (DNS, WHOIS, visual AI) reduce single-point-of-failure." |
| **Competitor response** | 🟡 Medium | What if ZeroFox launches a free tier? | "Incumbents can't go down-market without cannibalizing their $5K+/mo customers. This is the classic innovator's dilemma — we have the PLG DNA they lack." |
| **AI dependency** | 🟢 Low | What if AI costs spike? | "AI inference costs dropping 90%+ annually. Our architecture is model-agnostic — we can swap providers. AI is a cost advantage for us, not a risk." |
| **Regulatory** | 🟢 Low | Data handling, privacy | "We're building SOC 2 compliant from the start. DRP aligns with regulatory mandates (DORA, NIS2) — regulation is a tailwind, not a headwind." |

### Addressing the Solo Founder Question

This will come up in every investor meeting. Prepare for it:

**The honest story:**
> "I'm building DoppelDown with a lean, AI-augmented approach. I have deep domain expertise from years in cybersecurity presales — I understand both the technology and the buyer. My first priority post-funding is hiring a senior engineer to scale the technical team. In the meantime, I'm leveraging AI tools to move at 3–5x the speed of a traditional solo developer."

**What investors actually want to hear:**
1. You're actively looking for a co-founder/CTO
2. You have a clear hiring plan
3. You're not doing everything yourself out of stubbornness — it's a strategic choice for this stage
4. You have advisors / supporters who provide leverage

**What helps enormously:**
- A technical advisor with cybersecurity credibility (equity compensation)
- An LOI (letter of intent) from a prospective CTO hire
- Proof of rapid execution (ship velocity, feature releases, customer feedback)

## 13. Appendices

### Appendix A: Comparable Fundraises (DRP / Brand Protection)

| Company | Round | Amount | Year | Valuation (est.) | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|------|------------------|-------|
| **Doppel** | Series A | $35M | 2024 | ~$150M | AI-powered brand protection (enterprise) |
| **Bolster** | Series B | $26M | 2023 | ~$100M+ | Digital risk protection |
| **Allure Security** | Series A | $14M | 2023 | ~$60M | Brand impersonation |
| **Nudge Security** | Seed | $7M | 2023 | ~$30M | SaaS security (adjacent) |
| **Red Points** | Series C | $55M | 2022 | ~$200M+ | Brand protection |

| **PhishFort** | Acquired | — | 2021 | Est. $20M+ | Acquired by Bolster |

**Key insight:** The market has proven investor appetite at significant valuations. DoppelDown's differentiation (SMB-accessible, PLG, transparent pricing) is a novel wedge that none of these raised on.

### Appendix B: Key Metrics Investors Will Want

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters | Target |
|--------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **MRR** | Monthly recurring revenue | Core business health | Growing 15%+ MoM |
| **ARR** | Annual recurring revenue (MRR × 12) | Scale indicator | — |
| **MoM Growth** | (This month MRR / last month MRR) - 1 | Trajectory | 15–30% at seed |
| **Customer Count** | Total paying customers | Market validation | 50+ at seed |
| **ARPC** | Average revenue per customer | Pricing power | $150–$250/mo |
| **Logo Churn** | % of customers who cancel per month | Product-market fit | <5% monthly |
| **Revenue Churn** | % of revenue lost per month | Revenue health | <3% monthly |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | Revenue from existing customers this period / same cohort last period | Expansion power | >110% |
| **CAC** | Cost to acquire a customer | Efficiency | <$300 (PLG) |
| **LTV** | Lifetime value of a customer | Economics | >$2,000 |
| **LTV/CAC** | Ratio of lifetime value to acquisition cost | Sustainability | >5x |
| **Payback Period** | Months to recoup CAC | Cash efficiency | <6 months |
| **Gross Margin** | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | Business quality | >80% |
| **Burn Rate** | Monthly cash outflow | Runway | — |
| **Runway** | Cash / monthly burn | Survival | >18 months post-raise |
| **Activation Rate** | % of signups who complete onboarding | Funnel health | >40% |
| **Free → Paid Conversion** | % of free users who upgrade | PLG effectiveness | >3% |

### Appendix C: Investor Meeting Framework

**Before the meeting:**
- Research the investor (portfolio, thesis, recent investments, blog posts, tweets)
- Prepare 3 specific asks (intro, advice, investment)
- Have a 30-second, 2-minute, and 10-minute version of your pitch

**The meeting structure (30 min):**
```
0–2 min:  Rapport building (research something personal about them)
2–5 min:  Your 2-minute pitch (hook them)
5–20 min: Deep dive on what they're most interested in (follow their energy)
20–25 min: Q&A (answer directly, don't hedge)
25–28 min: Your asks (specific intros, feedback, next steps)
28–30 min: Clear next step ("When should we reconnect? Would you like to see our data room?")
```

**After the meeting:**
- Send thank-you email within 2 hours
- Deliver on any promises within 24 hours
- Add to monthly update list (with permission)
- Log in investor CRM: date, notes, interest level, next step

### Appendix D: Founder's Fundraising Mental Model

**Things to remember when fundraising gets hard:**

1. **Fundraising is sales.** You're selling equity. Apply sales discipline — pipeline, follow-up, qualification, closing.

2. **"No" usually means "not yet."** Keep investors warm with monthly updates. Many seed investors initially pass, then invest 6–12 months later when traction proves them wrong.

3. **The best time to raise is when you don't need to.** Build with revenue first. Investors can smell desperation.

4. **Valuation is vanity, terms are sanity.** A $15M valuation with toxic terms is worse than a $10M valuation with founder-friendly terms. Focus on the terms table in §8.

5. **Your job is building the company, not fundraising.** Set a deadline (8–12 weeks of active fundraising). If you don't close, go back to building and try again in 6 months with more traction.

6. **Founder-market fit is your superpower.** You worked in cybersecurity presales. You know the buyer, the market, and the problem intimately. Very few founders can say that.

7. **Australia is not a disadvantage.** Canva, Atlassian, SafetyCulture, Loom — some of the world's best SaaS companies were built in Australia. The R&D Tax Incentive is a meaningful structural advantage.

8. **One "yes" is all you need.** You don't need 50 investors to say yes. You need one lead investor, and the rest follow.
