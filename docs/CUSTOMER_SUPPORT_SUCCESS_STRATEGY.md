## 1. Executive Summary

### The Strategic Context

DoppelDown is the **only self-serve, transparently-priced brand protection tool** in a market dominated by enterprise vendors charging $15K–$250K/year with opaque sales processes. This positioning creates a unique customer support challenge and opportunity:

**The Challenge:** DoppelDown's customers are SMBs, marketing managers, and MSPs who are often encountering brand protection for the first time. They don't have dedicated security teams. They need guidance, not just a tool.

**The Opportunity:** Competitors hide behind "Contact Sales" — they don't provide accessible support to smaller customers. DoppelDown can make **world-class, responsive, human support** a core differentiator at every tier, including free.

### The One-Line Support Philosophy

> **"Every support interaction should make the customer feel like they have a cybersecurity expert on their team — not like they're filing a ticket into a void."**

### Key Strategic Decisions

| Decision | Approach | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Support for free users | Yes — email + KB | Free users are future paid customers. Ghosting them kills conversion. |
| Response time goal | <4 hours (business hours) | Faster than any enterprise competitor; matches SMB expectations |
| Primary channel | Email + in-app | Low overhead, searchable, async-friendly for a lean team |
| Live chat | Phase 2 (Month 3+) | Premature at <50 customers; email is fine |
| Phone support | Enterprise only | Not scalable at this stage; save for high-value accounts |
| Self-service priority | HIGH | Every KB article reduces ticket volume and scales infinitely |
| Proactive outreach | YES — core strategy | Don't wait for problems; the "Found Something" email approach applied to support |

### Revenue Impact Model

| Support Activity | Retention Impact | Revenue Impact (at 100 customers) |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Fast response (<4h) | +15% retention | +$1,500/mo saved from prevented churn |
| Proactive threat alerts | +20% retention | +$2,000/mo saved |
| Onboarding success call | +25% upgrade rate | +$2,500/mo in upgrades |
| Quarterly business review (Business+) | +30% retention | +$3,000/mo saved |
| Knowledge base (self-serve) | -40% ticket volume | Saves ~10 hrs/week of support time |

## 2. Support Philosophy & Principles

### The DoppelDown Support Promise

We exist because enterprise vendors told SMBs "you're too small for us." Our support must never make a customer feel that way. Every interaction should reinforce: **you matter, your brand matters, and we're here to protect it.**

### Core Principles

#### 1. Be a Guide, Not a Gatekeeper
Most DoppelDown customers are not cybersecurity experts. They're business owners, marketing managers, and MSP operators who need help understanding what a "homoglyph domain" means and why it's dangerous. Our support isn't just "how to use the tool" — it's **"how to protect your brand."**

**In practice:**
- Explain the *why* alongside the *how*
- When a customer asks "what does this threat mean?", don't just explain the UI — explain the real-world risk
- Offer actionable recommendations, not just feature documentation
- Use plain language; avoid jargon unless the customer speaks it first

#### 2. Speed Wins Trust
In the enterprise brand protection world, support response times are measured in days. DoppelDown should be measured in hours. A fast, helpful response from a founder or early team member creates the kind of loyalty that enterprise vendors can never match.

**In practice:**
- Acknowledge every ticket within 1 hour (even if the full answer takes longer)
- Set clear expectations: "I'm looking into this and will have an answer by [time]"
- If it's going to take more than 4 hours, proactively update the customer
- Use canned responses for common questions — but personalize them

#### 3. Proactive > Reactive
Don't wait for customers to reach out with problems. Be the team that emails them saying "Hey, we noticed a new critical threat against your brand — here's what it means and what we recommend." This is the single most powerful retention lever in the entire strategy.

**In practice:**
- Monitor scan results for new critical/high threats → proactive outreach
- Check in after first scan, first week, first month
- Send monthly protection summaries (automated)
- Alert customers when their scan coverage changes (new social platform added, etc.)

#### 4. Every Conversation is a Product Signal
Support tickets are the most honest form of product feedback. Track patterns, surface them to product development, and close the loop with customers when their feedback leads to changes.

**In practice:**
- Tag every ticket with a category and sub-category
- Weekly review of ticket themes
- "You asked for it" announcement when shipping features from feedback
- Keep a public changelog and reference it in support replies

#### 5. Transparency is the Brand
DoppelDown's entire market positioning is built on transparency (pricing, features, results). Support must be equally transparent:

**In practice:**
- If there's a bug, say so. Don't hide behind "we're looking into it"
- If a feature doesn't exist yet, say "it's on our roadmap for Q[X]" — or "honestly, we haven't planned that yet, but I'm adding it to our list"
- Share scan limitations openly: "Our social media scanning is best-effort for some platforms because they limit automated access"
- Never promise what you can't deliver

## 3. Support Tiers & SLAs

### Tier Structure

| | Free | Growth ($79/mo) | Business ($199/mo) | Enterprise ($499/mo) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Email support** | ✅ Best-effort | ✅ Priority | ✅ Priority | ✅ Priority |
| **Knowledge base** | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access |
| **In-app help** | ✅ Tooltips + KB | ✅ Tooltips + KB | ✅ Tooltips + KB + chat | ✅ All |
| **Response SLA** | 24h (business hours) | 8h (business hours) | 4h (business hours) | 2h (business hours) |
| **Critical incident SLA** | 24h | 8h | 2h | 1h |
| **Onboarding** | Self-serve + email tips | Welcome email + check-in | 30-min onboarding call | Dedicated onboarding |
| **Account management** | — | — | Quarterly check-in | Monthly success call |
| **Threat guidance** | KB articles | KB + email guidance | Personalized threat brief | Dedicated analyst review |
| **Takedown assistance** | Templates only | Templates + guidance | Guided takedown support | Managed takedown support |
| **Phone/video** | — | — | By appointment | Scheduled regular calls |
| **Custom reports** | — | — | — | ✅ |
| **SLA commitment** | Best effort | Published SLA | Published SLA + credits | Custom SLA agreement |

### SLA Definitions

**Response Time** = time from ticket creation to first meaningful response (not auto-acknowledgment).

**Resolution Time** = time from ticket creation to confirmed resolution or workaround provided.

| Severity | Definition | Examples | Response Target | Resolution Target |
|----------|------------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Critical (P1)** | Service down or major feature broken for all users | Scans not running, dashboard unreachable, billing errors, data loss | 1h | 4h |
| **High (P2)** | Major feature broken for individual user, or security concern | Scan stuck, evidence not loading, false positives on critical threats | 4h | 24h |
| **Medium (P3)** | Feature partially broken, workaround exists | Report formatting issue, slow scans, notification delay | 8h | 72h |
| **Low (P4)** | Minor issue, cosmetic, or feature request | UI glitch, wording improvement, nice-to-have feature | 24h | Best effort |

### SLA Credit Policy (Business & Enterprise Only)

If DoppelDown fails to meet published SLA targets:

| Breach | Credit |
|--------|--------|
| Response time exceeded by <2x | 5% of monthly bill |
| Response time exceeded by 2x–5x | 10% of monthly bill |
| Response time exceeded by >5x | 25% of monthly bill |
| Service outage >4 hours (P1) | 25% of monthly bill |
| Service outage >12 hours (P1) | 50% of monthly bill |

Credits are applied automatically when SLAs are tracked. No customer should have to ask for an SLA credit — that's table stakes for trust.

### 4.2 Customer Health Scoring

Track customer health to prioritize outreach and predict churn.

#### Health Score Components

| Signal | Weight | Healthy | At Risk | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Login frequency** | 25% | Weekly+ | Monthly | >30 days absent |
| **Scan activity** | 20% | Regular auto-scans + manual | Auto-scans only | No scans in 14 days |
| **Threat review** | 20% | Views threats within 24h of alert | Views within 7 days | Doesn't review threats |

| **Billing health** | 10% | Current | Payment retry | Failed payment |

#### Health Score Calculation

```
Health Score = (login_score × 0.25) + (scan_score × 0.20) + 
              (threat_review_score × 0.20) + (feature_score × 0.15) +

## 5. Knowledge Base & Self-Service

### 5.1 Knowledge Base Strategy

**Goal:** 80% of common questions answered without contacting support. Every KB article should be the best page on the internet for that topic.

**Hosting:** Built into the DoppelDown marketing site at `/help` or `/docs`. Not a separate subdomain — it should be integrated for SEO and UX cohesion.

**Search:** Full-text search across all articles. Auto-suggest in the in-app help widget.

## 6. Proactive Engagement Strategy

### 6.1 The Core Idea

DoppelDown's biggest retention lever isn't reactive support — it's **proactive outreach that proves the product is working**. Every email that says "we found something" reinforces the subscription value. Silence is the enemy.

### 6.2 Automated Proactive Touchpoints

#### Trigger-Based Outreach

| Trigger | Action | Channel | Template |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| New critical threat detected | Immediate alert + plain-language explanation | Email + in-app | "⚠️ Critical: We detected a phishing domain targeting your brand" |
| New high threat detected | Alert within 1 hour | Email + in-app | "New threat: [domain] looks suspicious — here's what we found" |
| First scan completes | Results summary + what to do next | Email | "Your first scan is complete — X threats found" |
| Scan finds zero threats | Positive reinforcement | Email | "Good news — your brand looks clean. We'll keep watching." |
| Weekly digest | Summary of all activity | Email | "Your weekly brand protection summary" |
| Monthly report | Comprehensive monthly review | Email | "Your month in brand protection — [Month] [Year]" |
| Threat resolved (domain goes offline, etc.) | Good news notification | Email + in-app | "Update: The phishing domain we flagged is now offline" |
| New social platform scan added | Feature announcement | In-app | "We now monitor [Platform] for brand impersonation" |
| Plan usage approaching limit | Upsell opportunity | In-app + email | "You're monitoring 3/3 brands — add more with Business plan" |

#### Time-Based Outreach

| Timing | Action | Channel | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Day 1 | Welcome + setup tips | Email | Get them started |
| Day 2 (if no scan) | Nudge to run first scan | Email | Prevent drop-off |
| Day 2 (if scan done) | Personalized findings | Email | Reinforce value |
| Day 7 | First week summary | Email | Retention touchpoint |
| Day 14 | Feature discovery + soft upgrade | Email | Conversion |
| Day 30 | Monthly review | Email | Retention |
| Day 60 | Health check | Email | Re-engagement |
| Day 90 | Quarterly review | Email or call | Deep engagement |
| Day 180 | Half-year review + NPS survey | Email | Feedback + retention |
| Day 365 | Anniversary + renewal preview | Email | Annual review |

### 6.3 The "Your Brand Protection Report" (Monthly)

**The most important proactive artifact in the entire strategy.**

Every paying customer receives a monthly email report that serves as a tangible proof of value. This report should answer the question: "What did I get for my $X this month?"

**Report Contents:**

│  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS                                │
│  1. Review the high-severity threat: acm3-corp.com  │
│     has active MX records (email could be used for  │
│     phishing). Consider a takedown report.          │
│  2. Register acme-corp.net defensively — it's       │
│     available and commonly used for impersonation.  │
│                                                     │
│  VALUE DELIVERED                                    │
│  💰 Estimated attack prevention value: $47,000      │
│     (based on average phishing attack cost for      │
│      businesses your size)                          │
│                                                     │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this matters:**
- It's the single strongest churn prevention mechanism
- It transforms DoppelDown from "a tool I log into sometimes" to "my brand protection service"
- It provides shareable proof of value (customer can forward to their boss/board)
- The "Estimated attack prevention value" frames the ROI of the subscription

### 6.4 Proactive Threat Guidance

When a critical or high-severity threat is detected, don't just send an alert — send guidance:

**Standard alert (what most tools do):**
> "New threat detected: acm3-corp.com — High severity"

**DoppelDown proactive guidance (what we do):**
> "⚠️ We detected a high-severity threat against your brand:
> 
> **acm3-corp.com** was registered 3 days ago and has:
> - MX records pointing to Microsoft 365 (email capability)
> - An SSL certificate (looks legitimate to visitors)
> - No website content yet (could be staging for phishing)
> 
> **What this means:** Someone may be preparing to send emails that look like they come from your company. This is a common setup for business email compromise (BEC) attacks.
> 
> **What we recommend:**
> 1. Generate a takedown report (takes 30 seconds in your dashboard)
> 2. Report the domain to the registrar (instructions included in the report)
> 3. Alert your team/customers if needed
> 4. Consider adding a DMARC record to your real domain to prevent email spoofing
> 
> **Need help?** Reply to this email and we'll walk you through the takedown process."

This kind of guidance is what makes DoppelDown a *service*, not just a tool. It's what justifies $79-$499/month and it's what enterprise competitors charge $50K+/year for.

### 6.5 Expansion Signals and Outreach

Watch for signals that a customer is ready for a higher tier:

| Signal | Indicates | Outreach |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Tries to add brand beyond plan limit | Needs more brands | "Looks like you need more than [X] brands — Growth/Business plan covers [Y]" |
| Exports multiple reports | Active takedown work | "Doing a lot of takedowns? Business plan includes guided takedown support" |
| Invites another team member | Organization growing | "Need team access? Business plan includes 3 seats" |
| Asks about API | Technical integration | "API access is available on Business and Enterprise plans" |
| Consistently high scan frequency | Power user | "You're getting great use out of DoppelDown — want to unlock daily scans?" |
| Multiple high-severity threats | Under active attack | "Your brand is seeing elevated threats — let's talk about enhanced monitoring" |

## 7. Customer Feedback Loops

### 7.1 Feedback Collection Mechanisms

#### In-App Micro-Surveys

**Post-Scan Survey (shown after first 3 scans, then monthly):**
```
"How useful were your scan results?"
[ 😞 Not useful ]  [ 😐 Somewhat ]  [ 😊 Very useful ]  [ 🤩 Extremely useful ]
[Optional: Tell us more → text field]
```

**Post-Support Interaction:**
```
"How was your support experience?"
[ 👎 Poor ]  [ 👍 Good ]  [ ⭐ Excellent ]
[What could we improve? → text field]
```

**Feature Request Widget (persistent, bottom-right):**
```
"Have an idea for DoppelDown?"
[Suggest a feature →]
  └─ Opens simple form: Title + Description + "How important is this to you?" (1-5)
```

#### NPS Survey (Quarterly)

Send via email to all paying customers at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days:

```
Subject: Quick question (takes 10 seconds)

On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend DoppelDown to a colleague?

[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]

[After selection, show follow-up:]
- Promoters (9-10): "What do you love most?" + "Would you write a short review?"
- Passives (7-8): "What would make us a 10?"
- Detractors (0-6): "We're sorry to hear that. What's the biggest thing we could improve?"
```

**NPS Targets:**
| Timeframe | Target | Industry Average |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Month 1 | >30 | ~20 for B2B SaaS |
| Month 6 | >40 | ~25 for B2B SaaS |
| Year 1 | >50 | ~30 for B2B SaaS |

#### Cancellation Survey

When a customer cancels (downgrades or churns), collect feedback:

```
"We're sorry to see you go. What's the main reason?"
○ Too expensive
○ Not enough features
○ Too many false positives
○ Didn't find real threats
○ Found an alternative
○ Business closed / no longer needed
○ Other: _______________

[Optional: Anything else you'd like us to know?]

"Would you be open to a quick 5-minute call to share your feedback? 
 We'll credit you $25 in Amazon gift cards as a thank-you."
 [Yes, email me to schedule] [No thanks]
```

### 7.2 Feedback Processing Workflow

```
Feedback Received (any channel)
    │
    ├── Tag by category:
    │   ├── Bug report
    │   ├── Feature request
    │   ├── Usability issue
    │   ├── Pricing/billing
    │   ├── Performance
    │   ├── False positive
    │   ├── Missing coverage
    │   └── Praise / testimonial
    │
    ├── Tag by severity:
    │   ├── Critical (blocks usage)
    │   ├── High (significant friction)
    │   ├── Medium (nice to fix)
    │   └── Low (cosmetic/minor)
    │
    ├── Log in feedback tracker (Notion / Linear / GitHub Issues)
    │
    ├── IF bug → Create engineering issue
    │
    ├── IF feature request → Add to feature voting board
    │   └── Check if already requested → increment vote count
    │
    ├── IF praise → Add to testimonials pipeline
    │   └── Ask for permission to quote publicly
    │
    └── Acknowledge to customer:
        "Thanks for this feedback — I've logged it and [specific next step]."
```

### 7.3 Feature Request Board

Maintain a public (or semi-public) feature request board where customers can:
- Submit feature requests
- Vote on existing requests
- See what's "Planned," "In Progress," and "Shipped"

**Options (lean to start):**
- **Cheapest:** GitHub Discussions (free, already on GitHub)
- **Best UX:** Canny.io ($0-$400/mo) or ProductBoard
- **Simplest:** Notion page with a form submission

**Structure:**
```
📋 Feature Requests

🔥 Top Requested
├── API webhooks for threat alerts (47 votes)
├── White-label reports (32 votes)
├── Slack integration (28 votes)
└── DMARC monitoring (25 votes)

✅ Shipped
├── Social media monitoring — Jan 2026
├── PDF takedown reports — Jan 2026
└── Weekly digest emails — Jan 2026

🚧 In Progress
├── API access (Business+)
└── Multi-user accounts

📋 Planned
├── Zapier integration
├── Custom alert rules
└── Dark web monitoring
```

### 7.4 Closing the Loop

The most important part of any feedback system is **closing the loop** — telling customers what happened with their feedback.

#### "You Asked, We Built" Announcements

When shipping a feature that was requested by customers:

**Email to requesters:**
> Subject: You asked for it — [feature] is here!
> 
> Hey [Name],
> 
> Remember when you suggested [feature]? We built it. 🎉
> 
> [Brief description of what it does and how to use it]
> 
> Thanks for helping make DoppelDown better. Your feedback genuinely shaped this feature.
> 
> [Try it now →]

**In-app announcement:**
> "🆕 New Feature: [Feature Name]"
> Based on feedback from customers like you, we've added [brief description].
> [Learn more →]

#### Feedback Status Updates

When a customer submits feedback that won't be immediately actioned:

- **Logged:** "Thanks for this — I've added it to our roadmap tracker."
- **Under consideration:** "This is something we're actively evaluating for Q[X]."
- **Planned:** "Great news — we've scheduled this for development in [timeframe]."
- **Won't do (for now):** "We've decided not to build this right now because [honest reason]. Here's what we recommend instead: [alternative]."

## 8. Churn Prevention & Recovery

### 8.1 Churn Signals

| Signal | Lead Time | Risk Level | Action |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| No login in 14+ days | 2-4 weeks before churn | Medium | Re-engagement email |
| Payment fails (card expired, insufficient funds) | Immediate | High | Dunning sequence |
| Visits cancellation page | Days | Critical | Intercept with save offer |
| Support tickets with negative sentiment | 1-2 weeks | High | Escalate to Richard |
| Scan returns zero threats repeatedly | Weeks | Medium | Explain ongoing monitoring value |
| Competitor mentioned in support ticket | Days | Critical | Comparison + save offer |
| Usage drops >50% from their average | 2-3 weeks | Medium | Proactive check-in |
| Customer deletes a brand | Days | High | "Is everything okay?" email |

### 8.2 Dunning Process (Failed Payments)

Failed payments are the #1 preventable cause of churn in SaaS. A proper dunning sequence recovers 30-50% of failed payments.

```
Day 0: Payment fails
  └─ Retry immediately (Stripe does this automatically)
  └─ Send email: "Your payment didn't go through — please update your card"
  └─ Show in-app banner: "⚠️ Payment failed — update your payment method to continue"

Day 3: Second retry fails
  └─ Email: "Your DoppelDown subscription is at risk — update your card"
  └─ Highlight what they'll lose: "Your brand monitoring will pause on [date]"

Day 7: Third retry
  └─ Email: "Last chance — your brand monitoring pauses tomorrow"
  └─ More urgent in-app banner
  └─ Personal email from Richard: "Hey, I noticed your payment didn't go through.
      If there's an issue with pricing, let me know — I'd rather find a solution
      than lose you."

Day 10: Subscription paused (not canceled)
  └─ Email: "Your brand monitoring is paused — reactivate anytime"
  └─ Do NOT delete their data or brands
  └─ Allow instant reactivation when payment is updated

Day 30: Final notice
  └─ Email: "We've kept your data safe — come back anytime"
  └─ Account moves to free tier automatically
  └─ Data retained for 90 days

Day 90: Data cleanup
  └─ Final email: "Your DoppelDown data will be removed in 30 days"
  └─ Option to export data or reactivate
```

### 8.3 Cancellation Flow

When a customer clicks "Cancel Subscription":

```
Step 1: "Before you go..." Survey
  └─ "What's the main reason you're canceling?" [required]
     ○ Too expensive
     ○ Not enough features  
     ○ Too many false positives
     ○ Didn't find real threats
     ○ Found an alternative
     ○ Business closed / no longer needed
     ○ Other

Step 2: Tailored Save Offer (based on reason)
  ├── "Too expensive" → "Would a 20% discount for the next 3 months help? 
  │    We don't want price to be the reason you're unprotected."
  │    [Accept 20% off] [Continue canceling]
  │
  ├── "Not enough features" → "What feature would change your mind?
  │    We're shipping [upcoming feature] next month. Would you stay to try it?"
  │    [Tell us what you need] [Continue canceling]
  │
  ├── "Too many false positives" → "We're sorry about that. Can we schedule a
  │    10-minute call to tune your scan settings? Most false positives can be
  │    eliminated with a few adjustments."
  │    [Schedule a call] [Continue canceling]
  │
  ├── "Didn't find real threats" → "That's actually good news for your brand!
  │    Threats can emerge at any time — 60% of our users see new threats within
  │    90 days. Would you like to try a free month to keep monitoring?"
  │    [Accept free month] [Continue canceling]
  │
  ├── "Found an alternative" → "Would you mind sharing which tool? We genuinely
  │    want to learn. And if there's something specific they offer that we don't,
  │    we'd love to know."
  │    [Share feedback] [Continue canceling]
  │
  └── "Business closed / Other" → "Understood. We hope you'll think of DoppelDown
       if you need brand protection in the future. Your data will be available
       for 90 days if you decide to return."
       [Continue canceling]

Step 3: Confirm Cancellation
  └─ "Your subscription will remain active until [end of billing period].
      You can reactivate anytime before then without losing your data."
  └─ Show what they'll lose: "You'll lose daily scans, social monitoring,
      and real-time alerts"

Step 4: Post-Cancellation Email (24 hours later)
  └─ "We're sorry to see you go. Here's what will happen next..."
  └─ Reminder they can reactivate
  └─ Option to downgrade to free instead of full cancellation
```

### 8.4 Win-Back Campaigns

For customers who have canceled:

| Timing | Action | Message |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 7 days after cancel | "We've been monitoring your brand — here's what we found" | Send scan results (if still running free) |
| 30 days after cancel | "A lot has changed at DoppelDown" | Feature updates, improvements |
| 60 days after cancel | Personal email from Richard | "I genuinely want to understand what went wrong" |
| 90 days after cancel (if major new feature) | "We built [feature] — come back and try it" | Feature announcement + discount |
| Annual (if email open rates suggest interest) | "Yearly check-in — is your brand still protected?" | Appeal to security concern |

**Win-Back Discount Policy:**
- First win-back offer: 20% off for 3 months
- Second win-back (6+ months later): 30% off for 3 months
- Never discount more than 30% — devalues the product

## 9. Tooling & Infrastructure

### 9.1 Support Stack (Phase 1: 0-50 Customers)

**Keep it lean.** At this stage, Richard is the support team. Over-tooling wastes time and money.

| Function | Tool | Cost | Why |
|----------|------|------|-----|
| **Email support** | support@doppeldown.com (Gmail alias) | $0 | Simple, personal, direct. No ticketing overhead needed yet. |
| **Knowledge base** | Built into DoppelDown site (Next.js pages at `/help`) | $0 | SEO value, no third-party dependency, fully branded |
| **Email sequences** | Custom drip logic in codebase (cron + Supabase) | $0 | Already partially built. No need for Mailchimp at this scale. |
| **Feedback tracking** | GitHub Issues (private repo) or Notion | $0 | Where the code lives. Tag issues as `feedback`, `feature-request`, etc. |
| **NPS surveys** | Embedded in email (simple HTML + API endpoint) | $0 | Custom-built, no SaaS dependency |
| **Health scoring** | Supabase query + simple dashboard | $0 | Query user_activation + login data |
| **Analytics** | GA4 + Prometheus metrics (already built) | $0 | Already in codebase |

**Total cost: $0/month.** This is intentional. At <50 customers, the overhead of configuring Intercom, Zendesk, or HubSpot is not worth the marginal improvement. Richard's personal email is actually the *best* support channel at this stage because it's founder-to-customer.

### 9.2 Support Stack (Phase 2: 50-200 Customers)

When Richard can't keep up with email, it's time to add lightweight tooling.

| Function | Tool | Cost | Why |
|----------|------|------|-----|
| **Help desk** | Help Scout or Crisp | $20-50/mo | Shared inbox, saved replies, basic reporting. Feels personal (not enterprise-y) |
| **Live chat (in-app)** | Crisp or Intercom Starter | $0-89/mo | In-app messaging for paid customers |
| **Email marketing** | Loops.so or Customer.io | $0-50/mo | Automated drip sequences, better than hand-rolled |
| **Feedback board** | Canny.io (free tier) | $0 | Public feature voting, close the loop |
| **Status page** | Instatus or BetterStack | $0-20/mo | Transparent about uptime |
| **Analytics** | PostHog (free tier) or Mixpanel | $0 | Better funnel and retention analysis |

**Total cost: ~$50-200/month.** Justified when MRR exceeds $5K.

### 9.3 Support Stack (Phase 3: 200+ Customers)

| Function | Tool | Cost | Why |
|----------|------|------|-----|
| **Help desk** | Intercom or Zendesk | $150-400/mo | Full-featured, automation, AI assist |
| **CRM** | HubSpot CRM (free) + Sales Hub | $0-50/mo | Customer lifecycle management |
| **Email marketing** | Customer.io | $150/mo | Behavioral triggers, segmentation |
| **Knowledge base** | Intercom KB or standalone | Included | Integrated with support chat |
| **Community** | Discord or Discourse | $0-100/mo | Community-led support |
| **Monitoring** | BetterStack | $25/mo | Uptime monitoring + status page |
| **Analytics** | PostHog or Amplitude | $0-100/mo | Deep product analytics |

### 9.4 Support Email Infrastructure

**support@doppeldown.com** routing:

```
Incoming email to support@
    │
    ├── Auto-acknowledge: "Thanks for reaching out — we'll get back to you 
    │   within [SLA] hours."
    │
    ├── Auto-tag (basic keyword matching):
    │   ├── "cancel" / "refund" → billing
    │   ├── "bug" / "error" / "broken" → technical
    │   ├── "scan" / "threat" → product
    │   ├── "upgrade" / "plan" / "pricing" → sales
    │   └── Other → general
    │
    ├── Auto-link to customer account (match by email in Supabase)
    │
    └── Route to queue (at Phase 1, everything goes to Richard)
```

## 10. Staffing & Scaling Model

### 10.1 Staffing by Stage

| Stage | Customers | Support Staff | Customer Success | Total Head |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Launch (Month 1-3)** | 0-25 | Richard (part-time) | Richard | 0 dedicated |
| **Traction (Month 3-6)** | 25-75 | Richard + Ernie (AI) | Richard | 0.5 FTE |
| **Growth (Month 6-12)** | 75-200 | 1 part-time support rep | Richard | 1.5 FTE |
| **Scale (Year 2)** | 200-500 | 1-2 support reps | 1 CSM | 2-3 FTE |
| **Mature (Year 3+)** | 500+ | Support team lead + 2-3 reps | CS team lead + 1-2 CSMs | 4-6 FTE |

### 10.2 Richard's Time Allocation (Month 1-3)

At launch, Richard wears every hat. Here's a realistic time allocation:

| Activity | Time/Week | When |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Respond to support emails | 2-3 hours | Morning + evening checks |
| Review new customer scan results | 1-2 hours | Daily 15-min review per new customer |
| Proactive outreach (new customer check-ins) | 1 hour | 2-3 emails per week |
| KB article writing | 1 hour | Write 1 article/week |
| Feedback review and product decisions | 30 min | Sunday review |
| **Total** | **5-7 hours/week** | |

This is manageable alongside a full-time job. The key is **batching** — check support once in the morning and once in the evening, not constantly.

### 10.3 AI-Assisted Support

Ernie (the AI assistant) can handle several support functions:

| Function | How Ernie Helps |
|----------|----------------|
| KB article drafting | Write first drafts of help articles from product knowledge |
| Email template creation | Draft support email templates for common scenarios |
| Scan result summaries | Generate plain-language threat summaries for proactive outreach |
| Monthly report generation | Compile customer-facing monthly protection reports |
| Feedback categorization | Tag and categorize incoming feedback |
| Canned response suggestions | Suggest relevant KB links and templates for tickets |
| Onboarding email sequences | Draft and A/B test email copy |

### 10.4 First Support Hire Profile

**When to hire:** When support takes >15 hours/week of Richard's time, OR when average response time exceeds SLA targets for 2+ consecutive weeks.

**Title:** Customer Support Specialist (Part-Time / Contract)

**Key traits:**
- Clear written communicator (90% of support is email)
- Basic cybersecurity knowledge (or willingness to learn quickly)
- Empathetic and patient (customers are often confused or scared)
- Self-directed (Richard can't micro-manage while running the business)
- Bonus: Experience with SaaS support, help desk tools

**Where to find:**
- Upwork / Fiverr (contract, flexible hours)
- Australian cybersecurity community (LinkedIn)
- University cybersecurity students (cheap, eager to learn, often excellent)

**Compensation range:**
- Contract: $25-40 AUD/hour, 10-20 hours/week
- Part-time employee: $55-65K AUD (pro-rata)

## 12. Playbooks for Common Scenarios

### 12.1 Playbook: Customer Doesn't Understand Scan Results

**Trigger:** Customer emails asking "What does this mean?" or "Should I be worried?"

**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Great question — let me break down what we found.

[THREAT EXPLANATION — in plain language]

For example, "[domain]" is a domain that looks very similar to yours. It was 
registered on [date] and currently [has/doesn't have] an active website. Our AI 
scored it as [severity] because [reason].

**Should you be worried?**
- [If critical/high]: Yes — this looks like it could be used for phishing. 
  I'd recommend generating a takedown report (I can walk you through it).
- [If medium]: It's worth monitoring. We'll alert you if it becomes more 
  active. No immediate action needed.
- [If low]: This is a low-risk finding — likely a parked domain or common 
  misspelling. We flag these so you're aware, but they rarely become active threats.

**What I recommend:**
1. [Specific action based on severity]
2. [Second action if applicable]
3. Keep your automated scans running — we'll alert you if anything changes

Want me to walk you through generating a takedown report? Happy to help.

Best,
Richard
DoppelDown
```

### 12.2 Playbook: Customer Reports False Positive

**Trigger:** Customer says "This isn't a real threat" or "I own that domain"

**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for letting me know — I've marked [domain/account] as a known safe 
entity in your account. It won't be flagged in future scans.

False positives happen because our AI casts a wide net intentionally — we'd 
rather flag something that's safe than miss something that's dangerous. That 
said, we're constantly improving our detection to reduce noise.

A few things that help:
- You can mark any threat as "False Positive" directly in the dashboard 
  (click the threat → Actions → Mark as False Positive)
- Adding your own domains and social accounts in your brand settings helps 
  our AI distinguish your properties from impostors

Thanks for the feedback — every false positive report makes DoppelDown 
smarter.

Best,
Richard
```

**Internal action:** Log the false positive in the feedback tracker. If the same type of false positive is reported by 3+ customers, create an engineering issue to improve detection.

### 12.3 Playbook: Customer Wants Help with Takedown

**Trigger:** Customer asks "How do I get this domain taken down?" or "Can you help me with a takedown?"

**Response Template (Free/Growth):**
```
Hi [Name],

Absolutely — here's how to get a domain taken down:

**Step 1: Generate a takedown report in DoppelDown**
Go to the threat → Click "Generate Report" → Choose PDF format.
This creates a professional evidence package with screenshots, WHOIS data, 
and registration details.

**Step 2: Identify the registrar**
The report includes WHOIS data showing which registrar hosts the domain 
(e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare). Most registrars have an abuse 
complaint form.

**Step 3: Submit the takedown request**
- [Registrar abuse page link]
- Attach the DoppelDown report
- Reference your trademark registration (if you have one)
- Explain that the domain is being used for brand impersonation/phishing

**Step 4: Report to Google Safe Browsing**
Submit the URL at https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/
This will trigger a browser warning for visitors.

**Typical timeline:** Registrars usually respond within 24-72 hours. Phishing 
domains are taken down faster than trademark disputes.

Need me to review your report before you submit it? Happy to take a look.

Best,
Richard
```

**Response Template (Business/Enterprise — guided support):**
```
Hi [Name],

I've reviewed the threat at [domain] and prepared a takedown strategy:

**Analysis:**
[Specific analysis of the threat, infrastructure, registrar, hosting]

**Recommended approach:**
1. [Specific registrar abuse process with direct link]
2. [Any additional reporting — Google Safe Browsing, APWG, etc.]
3. [If applicable: trademark-based UDRP recommendation]

**I've prepared:**
- A takedown report (attached) — ready to submit to the registrar
- Pre-written abuse complaint text (below) — you can copy/paste this into 
  the registrar's abuse form

[PRE-WRITTEN COMPLAINT TEXT]

Would you like me to review the submission before you send it? Or if you'd 
prefer, I can walk you through it on a call.

Best,
Richard
```

### 12.4 Playbook: Customer Considering Cancellation

**Trigger:** Customer mentions canceling, asks about refunds, or visits the cancellation page.

**Internal action BEFORE responding:**
1. Check their health score and usage
2. Review their scan results — any recent high-severity threats?
3. Check their support history — any unresolved issues?
4. Determine their plan and tenure

**Response Framework:**

```
Hi [Name],

I'm sorry to hear you're thinking about canceling. Before you decide, 
I wanted to check in personally.

[PERSONALIZED BASED ON REASON — see Section 8.3 save offers]

[If they have active threats]:
I also noticed that you currently have [X] active threats against your 
brand, including [specific high-severity threat]. If you cancel, you'll 
lose monitoring on these — and we won't be able to alert you if they 
escalate.

[If no recent threats]:
I understand that when the scans come back clean, it can feel like you 
don't need the service. But brand threats are unpredictable — 60% of our 
users see a new significant threat within their first 90 days. The value 
of DoppelDown is knowing immediately when something appears, not just 
checking once.

Regardless of what you decide, I'd love to understand what we could do 
better. Would you be open to a quick 5-minute chat?

Best,
Richard
```

### 12.5 Playbook: Customer Under Active Attack

**Trigger:** Customer reports they're currently being phished/impersonated, or scan reveals multiple critical threats simultaneously.

**Priority:** P1 — respond within 1 hour regardless of plan tier.

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Urgent — Action plan for the threats against [brand]

Hi [Name],

I've reviewed the threats against your brand and want to help you move 
quickly. Here's what I recommend doing in the next 24 hours:

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Today):**

1. ⚡ Report the phishing domain to Google Safe Browsing
   → https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/
   This adds a browser warning within hours.

2. ⚡ Submit abuse complaints to the registrar(s)
   → [Specific registrar link]
   I've attached a pre-filled takedown report you can submit directly.

3. ⚡ Alert your customers/team
   → If there's an active phishing page collecting credentials, your 
     customers need to know. Consider a brief email or social post:
     "We're aware of a fake [brand] website at [URL]. Our official site 
     is [your-domain.com]. Please do not enter any information on the 
     fake site."

**SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (This Week):**

4. Review your DMARC/SPF/DKIM records to prevent email spoofing
5. Check if the phishing domain has email capability (the report shows 
   MX records — if present, email spoofing is likely)
6. Consider registering common domain variations defensively

**I'm here to help with all of this.** Reply to this email or call me 
at [phone number if Enterprise] — I'll walk you through each step.

This is exactly what DoppelDown is for. Let's shut this down together.

Richard
DoppelDown Founder

### 12.6 Playbook: MSP/Partner Onboarding

**Trigger:** MSP or agency signs up with intent to manage multiple client brands.

**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Welcome to DoppelDown! I noticed you're [an MSP / managing multiple brands] — 
that's exactly the use case we're building for.

Here's how I recommend setting up:

**For your own brand:**
Add your MSP's domain first and run a scan. This serves two purposes — 
protects your own brand and gives you firsthand experience with the platform.

**For client brands:**
On your current plan, you can monitor up to [X] brands. Here's how most 
MSPs structure this:
1. Add each client as a separate brand
2. Set up email alerts for each (you'll get notified of all threats)
3. Use the takedown reports as client deliverables (your clients love 
   seeing evidence of the threats you caught)

**Partner pricing:**
We offer MSP partners a 20% discount on published rates. I'd love to 
discuss a partnership structure that works for your business. Would you 
be open to a quick call?

In the meantime, I'm setting up a partner evaluation account for you 
with [X] free brands for 60 days — no commitment, just evaluate with 
real client domains.

Best,
Richard
```
