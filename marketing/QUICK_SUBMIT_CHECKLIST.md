Post title: **Show IH: DoppelDown – Brand protection for businesses that can't afford $50K/year**

Post content:
```
Hey IH! 👋

I built DoppelDown after years in cybersecurity watching small businesses get destroyed by brand impersonation while the tools to prevent it cost $30-300K/year.

DoppelDown uses AI to detect:
- Typosquatting domains
- Phishing sites copying your brand
- Fake social media accounts
- Newly registered suspicious domains

**Pricing:** Free tier → $249/mo (enterprise)
**No sales calls.** Pricing on the website.

Would love feedback from the community!
