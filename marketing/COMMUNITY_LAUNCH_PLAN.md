## 2. Hacker News

### Show HN
**URL:** https://news.ycombinator.com/submit

**Official Rules (from HN):**
- Title must begin with "Show HN:"
- Must be something users can **play with / try out** — no landing pages, sign-up walls, or reading material
- Must be something you've personally worked on
- Make it easy to try without barriers (signups, emails) — more feedback that way
- Don't ask friends to upvote or comment (this is taken VERY seriously)
- A Show HN needn't be complicated or look slick — early stage is fine
- New features / minor upgrades are NOT substantive enough for Show HN
- Appears on /shownew first, then /show after reaching points threshold

**Approach:** 🟢 Explicitly designed for this — but execution matters

**Suggested Strategy:**
1. **Ensure the free tier works immediately** — HN users will bounce if they hit a signup wall before seeing value
2. Ideally: Let people enter a domain on the homepage and see results without signing up (DoppelDown already has this! ✅)
3. The founder should be the one posting and actively responding to ALL comments for 4-6 hours
4. Post at **9–10 AM EST on a weekday** (Tue/Wed/Thu best)
5. Don't post on the same day as a major tech news event

**Suggested Title:**
> "Show HN: DoppelDown – Brand protection for SMBs ($0–$249/mo vs. $15K+/yr enterprise tools)"

**Suggested Comment (post immediately after submitting):**
> "Hey HN, I built DoppelDown because brand protection tools have been absurdly expensive ($15K–$250K/yr) and inaccessible to small businesses.
>
> DoppelDown scans 500+ domain variations (typosquats, homoglyphs, TLD swaps), monitors 7 social platforms for impersonators, and uses AI to score actual threat level so you're not drowning in false positives.
>
> Free tier: 1 brand, 25 domains, 1 social account. No credit card. You can try it right now on the homepage — just enter your domain.
>
> Tech stack: [brief mention]. Happy to answer questions about the detection algorithms, pricing model, or anything else."

**Best Time to Post:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 9:30 AM EST

## 3. Product Hunt

**URL:** https://www.producthunt.com/

**Rules & Guidelines:**
- Schedule your launch in advance via the Product Hunt dashboard
- You need a "hunter" — either hunt it yourself or get a known hunter with followers
- Prepare 5+ images/GIFs showing the product in action
- Voting opens at 12:01 AM PT and runs 24 hours
- You need early momentum (first 1-4 hours are critical)
- Asking for upvotes is frowned upon, but sharing "We launched on PH!" is fine

**Approach:** 🟢 Designed for product launches

**Suggested Strategy:**
1. Build a PH community page and tease the launch 1-2 weeks before
2. Prepare: tagline, description, 5+ product screenshots/GIFs, maker comment
3. Get 2-3 teammates to be listed as makers for social proof
4. Share on all social channels at midnight PT: "We just launched on Product Hunt!"
5. Respond to every comment within 1 hour

**Suggested Tagline:**
> "Enterprise brand protection without the enterprise price tag"

**Suggested First Comment:**
> "We built DoppelDown because we were shocked that brand protection costs $15K–$250K/year. SMBs deserve the same protection as Fortune 500 companies. Our free tier lets you monitor your brand for $0. Try the demo on our homepage — just enter your domain. Would love your feedback! 🙏"

3. Share revenue milestones, user feedback, technical challenges
4. Cross-post in relevant groups (SaaS, Security, Solo Founders)

## The Problem
Brand impersonation costs businesses $X billion/year. Enterprise tools to fight it cost $15K-$250K/yr.

## 5. LinkedIn

### 5A. LinkedIn Personal Posts (Founder's Profile)
**URL:** https://linkedin.com

**Strategy:**
- LinkedIn organic reach is still excellent for founder content
- Write 3-5 posts leading up to launch (building anticipation)
- Use the "launch post" format: Story → Problem → Solution → CTA
- Tag relevant connections and companies
- Engage heavily in comments for the first 2 hours

**Suggested Launch Post:**
```
I just launched something I've been working on for [X months].

Brand protection tools cost $15,000 to $250,000 per year.

For small businesses? That might as well be a million dollars.

So I built DoppelDown.

It does everything the enterprise tools do:
✅ Scans 500+ domain variations for typosquatting
✅ Monitors social media for impersonators
✅ AI-powered threat scoring (no false positive noise)
✅ Evidence packages ready for takedowns

But it starts at $0. Free. No credit card.

Paid plans from $49/mo.

If you're an SMB owner, MSP, or anyone who cares about brand security
→ doppeldown.com

Try it now — enter your domain on the homepage, instant results.

Would love your feedback. 🙏

Brand protection tools cost $15K-$250K/year.
That means only Fortune 500 companies can afford to fight

## Key Principles

1. **Never copy-paste the same message everywhere.** Each community has its own culture — adapt.
2. **Spend 2 weeks lurking/contributing before you promote.** Reddit especially will destroy you otherwise.
3. **Lead with the problem, not the product.** "Brand impersonation costs SMBs $X" > "Check out my tool"
4. **The free tier is your superpower.** In every community, lead with "free, no credit card" — it removes all friction.
5. **The homepage demo is your secret weapon.** "Enter your domain on our homepage — instant results, no signup" is incredibly compelling.
6. **Respond to everything on launch day.** Every comment, every question. This is non-negotiable.
7. **Don't launch on a Friday or Monday.** Tue/Wed/Thu for maximum engagement.
8. **Stagger your posts.** Don't blast everything at 9 AM. Spread across the day for sustained momentum.
9. **Track everything.** Use UTM parameters: `?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=r_saas&utm_campaign=launch`
