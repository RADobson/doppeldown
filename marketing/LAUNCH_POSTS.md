**Title:** Show HN: DoppelDown – Brand protection that doesn't cost $15K/year

**Text:**
Hey HN,

I built DoppelDown (https://doppeldown.com) to solve a problem I kept seeing in cybersecurity: brand impersonation protection is wildly overpriced.

Enterprise tools like BrandShield, Red Points, and PhishLabs charge $15K–$250K+/year with mandatory sales calls. Meanwhile, small and mid-size businesses are getting hit with typosquatting, phishing sites, and fake social media accounts with no affordable way to fight back.

DoppelDown checks 500+ domain variations (homoglyphs, typos, TLD swaps), scans social media for impersonators, and uses AI to score threats by actual risk — so you're not drowning in false positives.

**How it works:**
1. Enter your domain
2. We scan for threats across domains + social media
3. Get scored results with evidence packages for takedowns

**Pricing:** Free tier (1 brand, 25 domains), paid from $49/mo. No "Contact Sales" gate.

Stack: Next.js, Supabase, Stripe. Deployed on Vercel.

Would love feedback from the HN community. What would make this useful for you?

## 2. Reddit — r/cybersecurity

**Title:** I built an affordable brand protection tool after seeing enterprises charge $15K+/year for domain monitoring

**Text:**
I work in cybersecurity sales engineering and kept running into the same problem: clients need brand impersonation protection but every tool costs $15K–$250K+/year with a mandatory sales call just to see pricing.

So I built DoppelDown — a self-serve brand protection platform that starts free and goes up to $249/mo.

What it does:
- Monitors 500+ typosquatting domain variations (homoglyphs, typos, TLD swaps)
- Scans social media for fake accounts
- AI-powered threat scoring to filter noise from real threats
- Automated evidence collection (screenshots, WHOIS, HTML archives) for takedown requests

Free tier: 1 brand, 25 domains, 1 social account, weekly scans.

Would love to get feedback from actual security professionals. Is this the kind of tool your clients/org would use? What features would be most valuable?

## 3. Reddit — r/smallbusiness

**Title:** Free tool to check if anyone is impersonating your brand online (fake domains, phishing sites, social media fakes)

**Text:**
Hey everyone — I built a free tool that scans for people impersonating your brand online. It checks for:

- Lookalike domains (typosquatting, homoglyphs)
- Phishing sites copying your brand
- Fake social media accounts

The free tier lets you monitor 1 brand with 25 domain checks and 1 social account. No credit card needed.

I built it because enterprise brand protection tools cost $15K–$250K/year, which is insane for small businesses. Most SMBs don't even know they're being impersonated until a customer gets scammed.

If you want to check your brand: https://doppeldown.com

Happy to answer questions about how brand impersonation works and how to protect yourself.

## 4. Reddit — r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** Launched my SaaS today — brand protection for SMBs at 1/100th the enterprise price

**Text:**
After months of building on the side while working my day job in cybersecurity, I just launched DoppelDown (https://doppeldown.com).

**The problem:** Brand impersonation (fake domains, phishing sites, social media fakes) is a growing problem. Enterprise solutions charge $15K–$250K+/year and hide pricing behind sales calls.

**The solution:** Self-serve brand monitoring with AI-powered threat scoring. Free tier included, paid plans from $49/mo.

**Tech stack:** Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, Vercel
**Business model:** Freemium SaaS with 4 tiers ($0, $49, $99, $249/mo)
**Target market:** SMBs, MSPs, digital agencies

This is genuinely day 1. Looking for feedback, early users, and honest criticism. What would you want to see in a tool like this?

**Text:**

**What:** AI-powered brand impersonation detection (fake domains, phishing sites, social media fakes)

**Why:** Enterprise competitors charge $15K–$250K+/year. I'm targeting the massive underserved SMB market at $0–$249/mo.

**Stack:** Next.js + Supabase + Stripe on Vercel

**Pricing:**
- Free: 1 brand, 25 domains, weekly scans

Would love feedback on pricing, positioning, or the landing page. Roast welcome.

## 7. LinkedIn Post (for Richard's profile)

🚀 Excited to announce the launch of DoppelDown — brand protection that doesn't cost $15K/year.

After years in cybersecurity, I kept seeing the same problem: businesses need to protect their brand from impersonators, phishing sites, and domain squatters — but the tools cost $15K–$250K+/year.

Most SMBs simply go unprotected.

DoppelDown changes that:
✅ 500+ domain variations checked (typos, homoglyphs, TLD swaps)
✅ Social media impersonation scanning
✅ AI-powered threat scoring
✅ Evidence packages for takedown requests
✅ Free tier included — no credit card needed

If you know a business owner worried about brand impersonation, I'd love for them to try it: https://doppeldown.com

And if you're in cybersecurity — I'd genuinely appreciate your feedback.
