## Email 2: First Scan Nudge (24 hours after signup, only if no scan run)

**Subject:** Did you know someone might be impersonating your brand right now?

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

We noticed you signed up for DoppelDown yesterday but haven't run your first scan yet.

Here's a reality check: the average brand has **14 impersonation threats** active at any given time. Most businesses don't know about them until a customer gets scammed.

Running your first scan takes 30 seconds:

1. Open your dashboard
2. Add your domain (e.g., yourbrand.com)
3. Click "Scan"

We'll do the rest.

## Email 3: Results Follow-Up (24 hours after first scan)

**Subject:** Your brand scan results — here's what we found

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Your first DoppelDown scan is complete. Here's your summary:

- **{{threat_count}} potential threats** detected
- **{{critical_count}} critical** findings need attention
- **{{domains_checked}} domain variations** checked

**What should you do next?**

1. **Review critical threats** — These are the findings our AI flagged as most likely to be real attacks. Start here.

2. **Check evidence** — Each threat includes screenshots, WHOIS data, and registration dates so you can verify them quickly.

3. **Generate a takedown report** — For confirmed threats, create a report you can send to the domain registrar or platform abuse team.

4. **Enable automated scanning** — Set it and forget it. We'll alert you when new threats appear.

## Email 4: Value Reinforcement (Day 7)

**Subject:** One week in — is your brand safer?

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

It's been a week since you joined DoppelDown. Here's what's happened:

- **{{total_threats}} threats** found across your brand(s)
- **{{new_threats_7d}} new threats** detected this week
- **{{scans_run}} scans** completed

**Brand impersonation is a moving target.** New fake domains are registered every day. Phishing campaigns come and go. That's why continuous monitoring matters more than a one-time check.

**Quick tips to get more from DoppelDown:**

✅ **Enable email alerts** — Get notified the moment a critical threat is found (Settings → Alert Preferences)

✅ **Add your social accounts** — We'll monitor Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, and more for fake profiles

✅ **Set up automated scans** — Let DoppelDown scan on autopilot so nothing slips through
