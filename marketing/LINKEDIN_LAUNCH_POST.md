## Post

I spent years in cybersecurity watching brands get destroyed by impersonators.

And I couldn't do anything about it.

↓

Here's what I kept seeing:

An attacker registers a domain like "yourcompany-login.com."
They clone the real website.
They send phishing emails to your customers.

By the time anyone notices, the damage is done — stolen credentials, lost revenue, broken trust.

The tools to catch this exist. But here's the dirty secret of brand protection:

**Every major vendor hides their pricing.**

Go try it right now. Visit BrandShield, Red Points, Bolster, ZeroFox, PhishLabs — any of them.

You'll find the same thing on every single site: "Request a Demo" or "Contact Sales."

No pricing page. No transparency. Nothing.

When you finally get a number? It's $15,000 to $300,000+ per year.

That works for Fortune 500 companies.

It doesn't work for the millions of small and mid-size businesses who are just as vulnerable — and often MORE targeted because they don't have security teams.

I kept thinking: this is wrong.

So I built something about it.

**Today I'm launching DoppelDown.**

It does what the enterprise tools do:
→ Scans for fake domains impersonating your brand
→ Detects phishing sites and social media impersonation
→ Collects evidence (screenshots, WHOIS, DNS records)
→ Uses AI to score threats by severity
→ Sends you alerts when something is found

But with one critical difference:

**Pricing is right on the website.**

$0/mo — Free tier (yes, really)
$49/mo — Starter
$99/mo — Pro
$249/mo — Enterprise

No sales calls. No demo requests. No annual contracts.

Sign up with your email. Add your brand. Run a scan. See results in minutes.

That's it.

I believe brand protection shouldn't be a luxury only enterprises can afford. If someone is impersonating your brand right now, you should be able to find out today — not after a 3-week sales process.

## Formatting Notes for Richard

1. **Copy the post text above exactly** — the line breaks are intentional. LinkedIn's algorithm favors posts that get people to click "see more," and the early hook + "↓" creates that expand.

2. **Post the hashtags as the first comment**, not in the main post. This keeps the post clean and still gets hashtag visibility.

3. **Add a relevant image.** Options:
   - A screenshot of DoppelDown's dashboard showing detected threats
   - A side-by-side: competitor "Contact Sales" buttons vs. DoppelDown's pricing page
   - A simple graphic: "Brand protection: $50K/year → $0/month"

4. **Timing:** Post between 8-9 AM Tuesday-Thursday in your primary audience's timezone. Tuesday and Wednesday tend to perform best on LinkedIn.

5. **Engage in the first hour.** Reply to every comment within 30 minutes. LinkedIn heavily weights early engagement when deciding how widely to distribute a post.

6. **Ask 3-5 people to comment meaningfully** (not just "congrats") within the first 30 minutes. A question or personal experience works best. This signals to LinkedIn that the post is generating real discussion.

7. **Don't edit the post after publishing.** LinkedIn suppresses reach on edited posts.

## Alternative Shorter Version (if the above feels too long)

I spent my career in cybersecurity. One thing I saw over and over: brands getting impersonated, and no affordable way to stop it.

Brand protection tools exist — but they cost $15K–$300K/year and every single one hides pricing behind "Contact Sales."

That works for Fortune 500 companies. Not for the rest of us.

So I built DoppelDown.

AI-powered brand protection with transparent pricing:

Free → $49 → $99 → $249/mo.

No sales calls. No annual contracts. Sign up and scan in 5 minutes.
