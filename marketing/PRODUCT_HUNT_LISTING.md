## Full Description / About Section

### The Problem

Brand impersonation is exploding. Attackers register lookalike domains, set up convincing phishing sites, and create fake social media profiles to steal from your customers — and destroy your reputation in the process.

The tools to fight this exist. But they cost $30,000–$300,000+ per year, require multi-week onboarding, and hide behind "Contact Sales" buttons. If you're not a Fortune 500 company, you're on your own.

### The Solution

DoppelDown is brand protection for the rest of us.

We use AI-powered scanning to continuously monitor for threats impersonating your brand — typosquatting domains, phishing sites, fake social accounts, and newly registered domains that look suspiciously like yours. When we find something, you get alerted with evidence: screenshots, WHOIS data, HTML archives, and AI-generated risk scores so you know exactly what to prioritize.

### What makes DoppelDown different

**1. Transparent pricing on the website.** Every competitor hides pricing behind a demo request. We show ours: Free / $49 / $99 / $249 per month. That's it.

**2. Self-serve from day one.** Sign up with an email, add your brand, and run your first scan in under 5 minutes. No sales calls. No 30-day implementations. No "let me check with my team."

**3. A real free tier.** Monitor 1 brand with weekly scans at zero cost. See the value before you pay anything.

**4. AI-powered threat analysis.** Every detected threat gets an AI-generated severity score so you're not drowning in false positives. Focus on what actually matters.

**5. Evidence that's ready for takedowns.** Screenshots, WHOIS records, DNS data, and HTML snapshots — collected automatically and ready to attach to abuse reports or send to your legal team.

### Who it's for

- **Small and mid-size businesses** that can't justify $50K/year but need brand protection
- **Startups and SaaS companies** where brand trust is everything
- **E-commerce brands** constantly targeted by fake stores
- **Digital agencies** managing client brand reputation
- **MSPs and MSSPs** looking for a brand protection offering to add to their stack

### Pricing

| Plan | Price | Brands | Domains Monitored | Scan Frequency |
|------|-------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Free | $0/mo | 1 | 25 | Weekly |
| Starter | $49/mo | 3 | 100 | Daily |
| Pro | $99/mo | 10 | 500 | Every 6 hours |
| Enterprise | $249/mo | Unlimited | 2,500 | Hourly + NRD monitoring |

## First Comment from the Maker (Richard)

> Hey Product Hunt! 👋
>
> I'm Richard, the maker of DoppelDown.
>
> I've spent my career in cybersecurity — working with businesses to protect their infrastructure, respond to incidents, and deal with the aftermath of attacks. Over the years, I kept seeing the same problem come up again and again: **brands getting impersonated.**
>
> Someone would register a domain that looked almost identical to a client's, stand up a convincing phishing site, and start stealing from their customers. Or they'd create a fake LinkedIn profile or social media page to run scams under a legitimate company's name.
>
> The frustrating part? The tools to catch this exist. But they're priced for enterprises — $30K, $50K, sometimes $200K+ per year. And every single one of them hides their pricing behind a "Request a Demo" button and a multi-week sales cycle.
>
> I watched small and mid-size businesses — the ones who are *most* vulnerable to impersonation — get completely shut out of brand protection because they couldn't afford it and couldn't even find out what it would cost.
>
> So I built DoppelDown.
>
> It uses AI to scan for fake domains, phishing sites, and social media impersonation. It collects evidence automatically. It scores threats by severity so you know what to act on. And it starts at **$0/month** with transparent pricing right on the website.
>
> No sales calls. No "contact us for pricing." No six-figure annual contracts.
>
> I believe brand protection should be accessible to every business, not just the ones with enterprise security budgets. If someone is impersonating your brand right now, you should be able to find out today — not after a 3-week sales cycle and a $50K purchase order.
>
> I'd love your feedback. What features matter most to you? What would make this more useful? Drop a comment — I'm here and reading everything.
>
> Thanks for checking out DoppelDown. 🙏

## Launch Day Strategy Tips

### Pre-Launch (1-2 weeks before)

1. **Build a "Coming Soon" page on Product Hunt** — Start collecting followers. Aim for 100+ pre-launch followers.
2. **Reach out to your network personally.** DM 50-100 people in your cybersecurity network and ask them to follow the upcoming page. Personal DMs convert 10x better than mass posts.
3. **Prepare all visual assets:**
   - Logo (240x240px)
   - Gallery images (1270x760px) — 4-6 images showing: dashboard, threat detection, evidence collection, pricing page, before/after comparison
   - Animated GIF or short video of the scan process (15-30 seconds)
   - Maker avatar (professional headshot)
4. **Teaser posts on LinkedIn/Twitter** — "Something I've been building is launching soon. Brand protection shouldn't cost $50K/year. Stay tuned." Build curiosity.
5. **Line up 5-10 "hunter" candidates** — Reach out to active Product Hunt hunters in the cybersecurity/SaaS space and ask if they'd be willing to hunt DoppelDown.
6. **Draft all copy in advance** — Tagline, description, first comment, responses to likely questions.

### Launch Day (12:01 AM PT)

1. **Launch at 12:01 AM Pacific Time.** Product Hunt resets daily at midnight PT. Launching early gives you the full 24-hour window.
2. **Post your first comment immediately** (the maker comment above) — This sets the narrative before anyone else.
3. **Send your pre-prepared message to your network.** Have a copy-paste DM ready:
   > "Hey [name]! I just launched DoppelDown on Product Hunt — it's a brand protection tool I built after years in cybersecurity. Would mean a lot if you could check it out and leave an upvote if you think it's useful: [link]"
4. **Be present all day.** Respond to every single comment within 30 minutes. Product Hunt rewards engagement. This is your most important job on launch day.
5. **Post on LinkedIn** (see separate LinkedIn post draft) — Time it for 8-9 AM in your primary audience's timezone.
6. **Post on Twitter/X** — Share the Product Hunt link with a short thread about why you built it.
7. **Post in relevant communities:**
   - Reddit: r/cybersecurity, r/smallbusiness, r/SaaS, r/startups (follow subreddit rules — don't just spam a link)
   - Indie Hackers
   - Hacker News (Show HN)
   - Relevant Slack/Discord communities
8. **Email your existing users/waitlist** — If you have any early users, email them asking for support.

### During the Day

- **Respond to every comment** — Even "cool product" gets a genuine thank you.
- **Share live updates** on LinkedIn/Twitter: "We're #5 on Product Hunt today! Here's what people are saying..."
- **If you get feature requests, acknowledge them publicly:** "Great idea! Adding that to the roadmap."
- **Track your ranking** and share milestones with your support network to drive more engagement.

### Post-Launch (Week after)

1. **Write a "lessons learned" post** on LinkedIn/Indie Hackers about the launch experience.
2. **Follow up with everyone who commented** — These are your warmest leads.
3. **Update the Product Hunt page** with a "Week 1 update" comment sharing early traction numbers.
4. **Capture the Product Hunt badge** ("Featured on Product Hunt") for your landing page.
5. **Repurpose the launch content** — The first comment becomes a blog post, the gallery images become social posts.

### Key Metrics to Track

- Product Hunt upvotes (goal: Top 5 of the day = ~300-500+ upvotes)
- Product Hunt comments (goal: 50+)
- Website visits from Product Hunt
- Free signups from launch day
- First paid conversions within 7 days
