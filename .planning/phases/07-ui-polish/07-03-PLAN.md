  <what-built>
UI polish foundation and dashboard integration:
- EmptyState, ErrorMessage, Skeleton components
- Button/Input with focus-visible accessibility
- Loading.tsx files for dashboard routes
- EmptyState applied to empty lists
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. **Loading States**
   - Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000
   - Open Chrome DevTools > Network > Throttle to "Slow 3G"
   - Navigate to /dashboard - should see skeleton cards, not spinner
   - Navigate to /dashboard/threats - should see skeleton list
   - Navigate to /dashboard/brands - should see skeleton cards

2. **Empty States**
   - If you have no brands: /dashboard/brands shows EmptyState with "Add Brand" button
   - If you have no threats: /dashboard/threats shows EmptyState with action
   - Dashboard "Recent Threats" section shows EmptyState when empty

3. **Focus States (Accessibility)**
   - Go to /auth/login
   - Press Tab key repeatedly
   - Buttons and inputs should show visible focus ring (blue outline)
   - Click a button with mouse - should NOT show focus ring
   - This confirms focus-visible is working

4. **Visual Check**
   - Overall look should be consistent
   - No broken layouts or missing styles
   - Skeletons match content structure (no jarring layout shifts)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe any issues found</resume-signal>
