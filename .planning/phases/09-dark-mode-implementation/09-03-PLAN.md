  <what-built>
    Complete dark mode implementation:
    - next-themes installed and configured
    - ThemeProvider wrapping app with system preference detection
    - Dark mode CSS variables with WCAG-compliant colors
    - Three-way theme toggle in dashboard header
    - Theme persistence across sessions
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Start dev server: npm run dev

    **1. DARK-01: Manual toggle**
    - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
    - Click theme toggle (Sun/Moon icon in header)
    - Verify dropdown shows Light, Dark, System options
    - Select each option - theme should change immediately

    **2. DARK-02: System preference**
    - Set theme to "System" in toggle
    - Change OS to dark mode (Windows: Settings > Personalization > Colors)
    - Page should automatically switch to dark mode
    - Change OS back to light mode - page should switch back

    **3. DARK-03: Dark palette quality**
    - In dark mode, verify:
      - Background is dark gray (not pure black)
      - Cards are slightly elevated from background
      - Text is clearly readable
      - Borders are visible but subtle
      - Brand colors (primary blue) still prominent

    **4. DARK-04: WCAG contrast**
    - In dark mode, check text readability:
      - Main text should be easily readable
      - Secondary/muted text should still be legible
      - Use browser DevTools > Lighthouse > Accessibility for quick check
      - Or use WebAIM Contrast Checker on sample colors

    **5. DARK-05: Persistence**
    - Select "Dark" theme
    - Close browser completely
    - Reopen and navigate to dashboard
    - Should still be in dark mode
    - No flash of light mode on load

    **6. DARK-06: Smooth transitions**
    - Toggle between themes
    - Colors should change smoothly (not instantly jarring)
    - No individual elements transitioning at different speeds

    **7. Light mode regression check**
    - Set theme to Light
    - Navigate through all main dashboard pages:
      - /dashboard
      - /dashboard/brands
      - /dashboard/threats
      - /dashboard/settings
    - Verify no visual regressions from Phase 8

    **8. Landing page check**
    - Navigate to http://localhost:3000 (landing page)
    - Landing page should maintain dark aesthetic regardless of theme setting
    - This is intentional (THEME-LANDING-01)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
    Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe any issues found
  </resume-signal>
