  <what-built>
Dashboard restructured with F-pattern layout, MetricCard components, and progressive disclosure via Collapsible sections.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard (login if needed)
3. Verify **3-second scan test** (DASH-01, DASH-03):
   - Can you identify active threat count within 3 seconds?
   - Can you identify how many brands are monitored within 3 seconds?
   - Is the most critical info (Active Threats) positioned top-left?

4. Verify **reduced clutter** (DASH-02):
   - Are Quick Actions collapsed by default?
   - Is Protection Score collapsed by default?
   - Is the dashboard less visually overwhelming than before?

5. Verify **progressive disclosure** (DASH-04):
   - Click "Quick Actions" - does it expand smoothly?
   - Click "Protection Score" - does it expand smoothly?
   - Does chevron icon rotate when expanding?

6. Verify **theme support**:
   - Toggle to dark mode (header toggle)
   - Are all metric cards readable?
   - Are collapsed sections properly styled?
   - Toggle back to light mode - still correct?

7. Verify **no regressions**:
   - Does Recent Threats list display correctly?
   - Does Your Brands sidebar work?
   - Can you click through to brand detail pages?
   - Can you click through to threat detail pages?
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" to confirm dashboard cleanup meets requirements, or describe any issues found.</resume-signal>
