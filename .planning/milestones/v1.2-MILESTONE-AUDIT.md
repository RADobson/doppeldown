**Total:** 1 item across 1 phase

### Recommendation

ErrorMessage component is ready to use. Could standardize error handling in future polish phase. Not blocking for launch.

## Build Status

Build succeeds. Pre-existing issues unrelated to v1.2:
- `/auth/reset-password` Suspense boundary warning
- API route static rendering edge case

These exist from v1.0/v1.1 and don't affect v1.2 functionality.

## Conclusion

**v1.2 milestone achieved.** All requirements satisfied. All phases verified. All E2E flows complete.

The milestone delivers:
- Distinctive branding with text-based logo
- Conversion-optimized landing page with honest copy
- Professional UI polish (loading states, empty states, focus states)
- Semantic color system enabling theme support
- Fully functional dark mode with persistence
- Scannable dashboard with progressive disclosure

**Ready for:** `/gsd:complete-milestone v1.2`
