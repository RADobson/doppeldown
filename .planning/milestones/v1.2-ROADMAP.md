## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Phase 8 included as architectural prerequisite for dark mode
- Text-based logo with underscore accent (BRAND-LOGO-01)
- Landing page uses dark theme by default (LAND-DARK-01)
- HSL format for CSS variables enabling Tailwind opacity modifiers (THEME-TOKEN-01)
- F-pattern dashboard prioritizes Active Threats (DASH-LAYOUT-01)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Verbose landing copy simplified per user feedback
- False trust signals (fake SSL/SOC2 claims) removed
- Pricing corrected to match tier-limits.ts
- TypeScript errors (quota null type, screenshot_url, downlevelIteration)

**Issues Deferred:**
- ErrorMessage component created but not integrated (orphaned)
- /auth/reset-password Suspense boundary warning (pre-existing)
- OpenAI Vision endpoint API path issue (pre-existing)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- ErrorMessage component ready but unused (error handling uses alert/inline text)
