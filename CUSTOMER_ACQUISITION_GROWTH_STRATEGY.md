## 1. Executive Summary

### The Thesis

DoppelDown operates in a **$3.5B+ brand protection market** growing at 15-20% annually, where every incumbent charges $15K-$250K+/year, hides behind "Contact Sales," and ignores the SMB segment entirely. DoppelDown's growth strategy exploits three structural advantages no competitor can easily replicate without dismantling their own business model:

1. **Transparent pricing** — The only player in the market that publishes prices ($0-$249/mo)
2. **Self-serve onboarding** — Sign up, scan, see threats in <5 minutes. Zero sales calls.
3. **Free tier** — No competitor offers free. This is the single most powerful acquisition channel.

### Growth Model

DoppelDown's growth engine is **product-led** with **content-assisted** and **channel-amplified** motions:

## 2. Market Opportunity & Sizing

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

The global brand protection market is estimated at **$3.5-4.5 billion** in 2026, growing 15-20% annually. This includes:
- Anti-counterfeiting & IP protection
- Digital brand protection (phishing, impersonation)
- Online brand monitoring
- Takedown services

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

DoppelDown's SAM is the **digital brand protection for SMBs and mid-market** segment:
- ~45 million SMBs globally with online presence
- ~15% have experienced brand impersonation or phishing targeting their brand
- ~5% are actively seeking solutions
- SAM estimate: **$800M-$1.2B** (SMBs willing to pay for digital brand protection)

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) — 24 Months

| Segment | Target Size | Penetration | Revenue |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Australian SMBs with online presence | 2.3M businesses | 0.01% (230 customers) | $170K ARR |
| Global English-speaking SMBs | ~20M businesses | 0.001% (200 customers) | $150K ARR |
| MSP/MSSP partnerships (10 partners × 20 clients each) | 200 managed accounts | Direct | $240K ARR |
| Marketing agencies (5 partners × 15 clients each) | 75 managed accounts | Direct | $90K ARR |
| **Total SOM (24 months)** | | | **~$650K ARR** |

### Why the Timing Is Right

1. **Phishing attacks up 150%+ since 2023** — Every news cycle amplifies the problem
2. **AI makes impersonation easier** — Deepfakes, AI-generated phishing sites lower the skill bar
3. **Regulatory pressure increasing** — Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) pushing SMB security standards
4. **Remote work normalised** — More business activity online = larger attack surface
5. **Enterprise vendor fatigue** — SMBs tired of being told "you're too small for us"

                    LOW PRICE ($0-$249/mo)
```

**DoppelDown occupies an empty quadrant.** Every competitor is in the upper-left: high price, sales-led. DoppelDown is alone in the lower-right: low price, self-serve. This is not an accident — it's structurally impossible for incumbents to follow without cannibalising their existing revenue.

#### Why Competitors Can't (Easily) Follow

| Structural Barrier | Why It Protects DoppelDown |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Revenue cannibalisation | A $50K/year customer won't pay $49/mo. Launching a cheap tier would destroy their own revenue. |
| Sales team economics | Their sales teams cost $200K+/year per rep. At $49/mo, the math doesn't work — they'd need to fire their sales force. |
| Enterprise DNA | Their product, support, contracts, and legal are all built for enterprise. Serving SMBs requires a fundamentally different operating model. |
| Brand positioning | Telling the market "we're affordable" undermines their premium positioning with existing customers. |
| Investor expectations | VC-backed competitors are optimised for enterprise ACV growth, not SMB volume. |

**This is DoppelDown's moat.** It's not a technology moat — it's a business model moat. The incumbents literally cannot compete on price and self-serve without destroying their existing business.

#### Positioning Statement

> **DoppelDown is brand protection for the rest of us.**
> Enterprise-grade AI detection at startup-friendly prices, with self-serve onboarding and transparent pricing.
> No sales calls. No six-figure contracts. No 30-day implementations.
> Sign up, scan, see threats in 5 minutes. From $0/month.

#### Positioning by Persona

| Persona | Positioning Angle |
|---------|-------------------|
| Sarah (SMB Owner) | "Know if someone is impersonating your brand — in 5 minutes, for free" |
| Dave (MSP) | "Add a $200/client/mo service line with zero new headcount" |
| Alex (Brand Manager) | "Generate a board-ready brand threat report in 5 minutes for $99/mo" |
| James (CTO) | "Self-serve, API-first brand protection. Transparent pricing. No sales calls." |
| Michelle (E-Commerce) | "Catch fake stores and social accounts before your customers do" |

## 6. Channel 1: Content Marketing & Thought Leadership

### Content Strategy Overview

DoppelDown's content moat is simple: **no competitor publishes useful brand protection content for SMBs.** The entire educational space is either enterprise-focused whitepapers or generic security advice. There's a content vacuum waiting to be filled.

### Content Pillars

| Pillar | Purpose | Audience | Example Topics |
|--------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Education** | Build awareness of the problem | All personas | "What is typosquatting," "types of phishing," domain protection basics |
| **Solution** | Show how to solve the problem | Problem-aware buyers | "How to protect your brand," takedown guides, monitoring guides |
| **Comparison** | Capture buyers evaluating options | Decision-stage buyers | "DoppelDown vs X," pricing comparisons, "best tools" roundups |
| **Industry** | Speak to specific verticals | Vertical-specific | "Brand protection for e-commerce/fintech/healthcare" |
| **Thought Leadership** | Build Richard's personal brand | All (especially MSPs) | "Why brand protection costs $50K," market insights, founder stories |
| **Customer Success** | Social proof and case studies | Evaluation-stage buyers | "How X company found 12 threats," ROI stories |

### Content Flywheel

```
PUBLISH CONTENT → RANK IN GOOGLE → ATTRACT VISITORS
        ↑                                    │
        │                                    ▼
  CREATE MORE ← LEARN FROM DATA ← SIGN UP FOR FREE
   CONTENT        (what converts)    │
                                     ▼
                               SEE THREATS → UPGRADE → ADVOCATE
                                                         │
                                                         ▼
                                                    SHARE CONTENT
                                                    (loop restarts)
```

### "Hero Content" Pieces (Highest Priority)

These 5 content pieces will drive more acquisition than everything else combined:

| # | Content Piece | Why It's Highest Priority | Est. Monthly Traffic (M6) |
|---|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **"Brand Protection Pricing: What Every Option Costs in 2026"** | Only transparent pricing content in the market. Every buyer searches this. Zero competition. | 2,000-5,000 |
| 2 | **"I Scanned 100 Australian Brands: Here's What I Found"** | Original data = links, press, social shares. No one else has done this. | 1,000-3,000 |
| 3 | **"Brand Protection for Small Business: The Complete 2026 Guide"** | Pillar page that ranks for dozens of long-tail keywords. Genuinely useful. | 1,500-4,000 |
| 4 | **"Best Brand Protection Tools 2026: Honest Comparison"** | Captures every buyer comparing tools. DoppelDown listed alongside enterprise tools. | 800-2,000 |
| 5 | **"The MSP's Guide to Offering Brand Protection as a Service"** | Directly targets the highest-LTV persona (Dave). No similar content exists. | 300-800 |

### Content Production Cadence

| Phase | Cadence | Focus |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Month 1 | 2 posts/week | Hero content + pillar pages |
| Months 2-3 | 2 posts/week | Supporting content + comparisons |
| Months 4-6 | 1-2 posts/week | Vertical content + case studies |
| Months 7-12 | 1 post/week | Optimization + updates + advanced topics |

### Content Distribution Strategy

Every piece of content gets distributed across 7 channels within 48 hours of publication:

1. **Publish on DoppelDown blog** (canonical URL)
2. **Repurpose as LinkedIn article** (full text, not just link)
3. **Extract key insight → LinkedIn post** (3-5 sentence hook)
4. **Share in relevant Reddit subreddit** (if genuinely helpful to that community)
5. **Email to subscriber list** (once >50 signups)
6. **Respond to relevant Quora questions** with excerpts + link
7. **Add to relevant industry newsletters** (pitch for inclusion)

### Thought Leadership via Richard's Personal Brand

Richard's cybersecurity background is the authenticity that makes DoppelDown's content credible. The content strategy includes building Richard's personal brand as a thought leader in "accessible brand protection."

**LinkedIn Content Calendar (Richard):**

| Day | Content Type | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| Monday | Insight / Data | "X% of small businesses have at least one impersonation domain registered. Here's how to check yours." |
| Wednesday | Industry Commentary | "Another [company] phishing campaign in the news. Here's what SMBs can learn from it." |
| Friday | Builder Story | "Week X of building DoppelDown: what I learned about [topic]." |

**LinkedIn Growth Tactics:**
- Comment on 5-10 cybersecurity/MSP posts daily (genuine insights, not pitches)
- Engage with MSP/MSSP content specifically — these are distribution partners
- DM anyone who engages meaningfully with Richard's posts
- Join LinkedIn Groups: Australian cybersecurity, MSP communities, SMB security

---

## 7. Channel 2: SEO & Organic Search

*Detailed in SEO_STRATEGY.md. Key strategic points below.*

### SEO is DoppelDown's #1 Long-Term Channel

Organic search will be the primary traffic driver by Month 6+ because:
1. **Every competitor ignores SEO for SMB keywords** — they target enterprise keywords
2. **Pricing keywords are uncontested** — no one publishes prices, so no one ranks for pricing queries
3. **The content compound effect** — each post builds authority for all other posts
4. **Sustainable CAC** — organic traffic has near-zero marginal acquisition cost

### Priority Keyword Clusters

| Priority | Cluster | Est. Monthly Searches | Competition | Revenue Potential |
|----------|---------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 🔴 #1 | Brand protection pricing/cost | 2,500 | Very Low | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🔴 #2 | [Competitor] alternative/pricing (×6) | 1,800 | Very Low | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🔴 #3 | Brand protection small business | 590 | Low | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🟡 #4 | What is typosquatting/domain squatting | 4,300 | Low | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🟡 #5 | How to protect brand from phishing | 880 | Low | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🟡 #6 | How to check if website is legitimate | 8,100 | Medium | ⭐⭐ |
| 🟡 #7 | Phishing statistics 2026 | 3,600 | Low-Med | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🟢 #8 | Brand protection [industry] | 500/ea | Very Low | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🟢 #9 | How to get fake account removed | 2,400 | Low | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 🟢 #10 | MSP brand protection | 300 | Very Low | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

### Technical SEO Priorities (Immediate)

1. **Fix `www` vs non-`www` canonical mismatch** — Critical, do immediately
2. **Ensure `/pricing` renders server-side** — Critical, Google can't read client-only pages
3. **Complete Google Search Console setup** — Critical for indexing
4. **Fix industry pages missing from sitemap** — These are free traffic waiting to be captured
5. **Stagger blog post publication dates** — 17 posts on one day looks like bulk content to Google

### Programmatic SEO Opportunities (Month 6+)

| Template | Number of Pages | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| `/compare/[competitor]` | 15-20 | "/compare/brandshield" |
| `/industries/[industry]` | 10-15 | "/industries/e-commerce" |
| `/use-cases/[use-case]` | 8-10 | "/use-cases/phishing-detection" |
| `/brand-protection/[country]` | 10-15 | "/brand-protection/australia" |
| `/threats/[threat-type]` | 8-10 | "/threats/typosquatting" |

Total: 50-70 programmatic pages, each targeting specific long-tail keywords.

---

## 8. Channel 3: Paid Advertising

### When to Start Paid Ads

**Not Day 1.** Paid advertising should begin when:
1. ✅ Product-market fit is validated (10+ paying customers)
2. ✅ Landing page converts at >3% (visitor → signup)
3. ✅ Free → paid conversion works (>10%)
4. ✅ LTV:CAC ratio is understood from organic/outbound
5. ✅ Budget: Minimum $1,000/mo allocated for testing

**Estimated start: Month 3-4**

### Google Search Ads (Primary Paid Channel)

Google Search captures the highest-intent buyers — people actively searching for brand protection solutions.

## 9. Channel 4: Partnership & Channel Strategy

### Partnership Tiers

```
TIER 1: MSP/MSSP PARTNERS (Highest priority — Month 1+)
├── Revenue model: Reseller with 20-30% margin
├── Target: 10 MSP partners in 6 months, each managing 10-20 client brands
├── Value: Highest LTV customers, stickiest relationships
└── Richard's network is the direct path

TIER 2: DIGITAL MARKETING AGENCIES (Month 3+)
├── Revenue model: Referral commission (20% Year 1) or reseller
├── Target: 5 agency partners in 6 months, each managing 10-20 client brands
├── Value: Access to brand-conscious client base
└── Reach via LinkedIn + content marketing

TIER 3: TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATIONS (Month 6+)

├── Value: Embedded distribution, lower acquisition cost
└── Reach via vendor partner programs

TIER 4: DOMAIN/HOSTING REGISTRARS (Month 12+)
├── Revenue model: White-label or bundled add-on
├── Targets: Namecheap, VentraIP, Crazy Domains (AU)
├── Value: Massive distribution at point of domain purchase
└── Long sales cycle but enormous volume potential
```

### MSP Partner Program (Detailed)

**The MSP channel is DoppelDown's highest-leverage growth lever.** A single MSP partner with 50 clients = 50 potential DoppelDown subscriptions managed under one relationship. Richard's cybersecurity career gives direct access to this channel.

#### Partner Program Structure

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Partner Discount** | 20% off list price (partner resells at full price or marks up further) |
| **OR Referral Commission** | 20% of first-year revenue per referred customer |
| **Free Evaluation** | 5 brands monitored free for 90 days (enough to cover 3-5 client demos) |
| **Partner Dashboard** | Multi-brand management view (roadmap feature — manual for now) |
| **Co-branded Reports** | Partner's logo on threat reports sent to clients (roadmap feature) |
| **Support** | Direct access to Richard via email/Slack for partner issues |
| **Training** | 30-minute onboarding call + recorded walkthrough video |
| **Marketing Materials** | Co-brandable one-pager, email template, presentation deck |

#### MSP Revenue Math

```
Average MSP: 40 clients
20% adopt brand protection: 8 clients
8 clients × $99/mo (Professional plan) = $792/mo
Partner pays: 8 × $79/mo (20% discount) = $632/mo
Partner margin: $160/mo (or charges clients $200+/mo for higher margin)

DoppelDown revenue per MSP partner: $632/mo = $7,584/year

10 MSP partners = $7,584 × 10 = $75,840 ARR
```

#### MSP Acquisition Playbook (First 10 Partners)

| Week | Action | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1-2 | Identify 20 MSPs from Richard's network | LinkedIn connections, former colleagues, vendor contacts |
| 2-3 | Send personalised outreach (phone/voice preferred) | Use MSP email template from GTM Playbook |
| 3-4 | Demo with interested MSPs (30 min) | Focus on margin opportunity, not features |
| 4-6 | Set up free evaluation accounts for first 5 MSPs | 5 brands each, hands-on support |
| 6-8 | Review evaluation results, close first partner deals | Formalise with simple partner agreement |
| 8-12 | Ask successful partners for referrals to other MSPs | Peer recommendations are gold in MSP community |

### Agency Partnership Program

**Digital marketing agencies** manage brand reputation for clients. Brand protection is a natural extension of brand management — but agencies don't have the tools to offer it.

#### Agency Program Structure

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Commission** | 20% of first-year revenue per referred client |
| **OR Reseller Discount** | 15% off list price |
| **Free Trial** | 3 brands, 60 days |
| **White-label Reports** | Agency branding on reports (future feature) |
| **Training** | 30-minute onboarding + recorded demo |
| **Co-marketing** | Joint blog posts, case studies, webinars |

#### How to Find Agencies

1. LinkedIn search: "digital marketing agency owner" + Australia
2. Clutch.co and GoodFirms directories: search "brand management" agencies
3. Search for agencies that specifically mention "online reputation management"
4. Richard's local Sunshine Coast business network

### Integration Partnerships (Month 6+)

| Integration | Platform | Distribution Impact | Effort |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| Shopify App Store | Shopify | Access to 2M+ merchants | High |
| ConnectWise Marketplace | MSP tools | Direct to MSP channel | Medium |
| Datto/Kaseya Marketplace | MSP tools | Direct to MSP channel | Medium |
| Zapier Integration | Workflow automation | Enterprise/tech buyers | Low |
| Slack Integration | Communication | In-workflow alerts | Low |
| PagerDuty/Opsgenie | Incident management | Technical buyers | Low |

---

## 10. Channel 5: Community-Led Growth

*Detailed community engagement plan in COMMUNITY_ENGAGEMENT_PLAN.md. Strategic summary below.*

### Community Strategy Principles

1. **Add value first, mention product never (or last)**
2. **Be a member of the community, not a marketer in disguise**
3. **One human voice (Richard), not a brand account**
4. **Build reputation through consistent helpful contributions**
5. **Play the long game — community trust compounds**

### Platform Strategy

| Platform | Audience | Content Approach | Frequency | Link to DoppelDown? |
|----------|----------|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Reddit (r/smallbusiness)** | SMB owners | "I built a tool" posts, helpful answers | 1 post + 5 comments/week | In "I built this" posts only |
| **Reddit (r/cybersecurity)** | Security pros | Educational content, market analysis | 5-10 comments/week | Only if directly relevant |
| **Reddit (r/msp)** | MSPs | Partner/feedback posts, helpful answers | 1 post + 3 comments/week | In partner posts |
| **Hacker News** | Tech builders | Show HN, technical discussion | 1 post + comments/month | Show HN post |
| **Product Hunt** | Early adopters | Launch + maker engagement | Launch week + ongoing | During launch |
| **Indie Hackers** | SaaS builders | Building in public, revenue updates | Monthly milestone posts | In context |
| **LinkedIn** | Professionals | Thought leadership, stories | 3 posts/week | Occasionally |
| **Quora** | Problem-seekers | Answer brand protection questions | 2-3 answers/week | In answers (naturally) |

### Building in Public Strategy

"Building in public" on Indie Hackers and Twitter/X is a powerful channel for DoppelDown because:
- Founders love supporting fellow founders
- Transparent pricing disruption is a compelling narrative
- Monthly revenue milestones create natural content beats
- Attracts media attention (journalists follow build-in-public founders)

**Monthly Update Template:**

```
Month [X] Update — DoppelDown

MRR: $X,XXX (+X% MoM)
Customers: XX paid, XXX free
Biggest win: [specific achievement]
Biggest challenge: [honest struggle]
What I learned: [insight]

Next month: [focus areas]
```

## 11. Channel 6: Product-Led Growth (PLG)

### PLG Is DoppelDown's Secret Weapon

DoppelDown has a natural product-led growth engine that most SaaS companies would kill for: **the free tier creates an immediate "aha" moment when the scan finds real threats the user didn't know existed.**

The entire PLG strategy is built around one principle:

> **Get the user to see their first real threat as fast as possible. Everything before that moment is friction. Everything after it is conversion opportunity.**

### Free Tier Design (The Hook)

| Feature | Free | Starter ($49) | Pro ($99) | Business ($249) |
|---------|------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Brands monitored | 1 | 3 | 10 | 25 |
| Scan frequency | Weekly | Daily | Real-time | Real-time |
| Domain monitoring | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Social monitoring | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Takedown reports | ❌ | Basic | Full | Full + assisted |
| Email alerts | Weekly digest | Daily | Real-time | Real-time |
| API access | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Support | Community | Email | Priority email | Dedicated |

**Key design principle:** The free tier should be valuable enough that users experience the "aha" moment, but limited enough that upgrading is obvious for anyone who cares about their brand.

### Upgrade Triggers (The Conversion Points)

| Trigger Event | What the User Sees | Conversion Message |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Add 2nd brand | "Your plan supports 1 brand" modal | "Starter plan: monitor up to 3 brands for $49/mo" |
| Click social scanning | "Social monitoring requires Starter+" | "See who's impersonating you on 8 platforms — $49/mo" |
| Request takedown report | "Takedown reports require Starter+" | "Get takedown-ready evidence for registrars — $49/mo" |
| Weekly scan limit | "Next scan in X days" notification | "Get daily scans for $49/mo. Real-time with Professional." |
| 14-day email nudge | "Your free trial of premium features ends" | "Keep premium features for $49/mo" |
| High-severity threat found | In-app alert | "This threat needs immediate attention. Upgrade for takedown assistance." |

### Viral Mechanics

| Mechanism | How It Works | Expected Impact |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Scan sharing** | "Share your brand's threat report with your team" (PDF link) | Team members see value → sign up |
| **Referral program** (Month 6+) | "Get 1 month free when you refer a friend who subscribes" | 5-10% of new signups via referral |
| **MSP expansion** | MSP signs up for 1 client → sees value → adds all clients | 5-20x expansion per MSP account |
| **Report distribution** | Branded reports shared with stakeholders include DoppelDown watermark | Passive brand awareness |
| **Social proof badges** | "Protected by DoppelDown" badge for websites (optional) | SEO link + brand awareness |

### Activation Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Improve |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Time to first scan | <5 minutes | Auto-fill domain, auto-start scan |
| % who complete first scan | >80% | Reduce onboarding steps, show progress |
| % who view threat details | >60% | Auto-navigate to threats after scan |
| Free → paid conversion rate | >15% | Upgrade prompts at natural friction points |
| Time from signup to paid | <14 days | Drip email sequence, usage-based nudges |

## 12. Channel 7: Direct Sales & Outbound

### Outbound Strategy (Richard's 30 Minutes/Day)

Direct outbound is the fastest path to first revenue. Richard's cybersecurity network is the most valuable asset DoppelDown has for early traction.

#### Daily Outbound Routine

| Time | Action | Duration |
|------|--------|----------|
| Morning | Check new signups, respond within 1 hour | 5 min |
| Morning | Send 2-3 personalised outreach messages | 10 min |
| Lunch | Comment on 3-5 LinkedIn posts in cybersecurity/MSP space | 10 min |
| Evening | Review metrics, respond to customer messages | 5 min |

#### Weekly Additions

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Monday | Write and publish 1 LinkedIn post |
| Wednesday | Send 5-10 cold emails |
| Friday | One community post (Reddit, HN, or forum) |
| Sunday | 20-minute weekly review |

### The "Found Something" Outreach (Highest-Converting)

**Before reaching out to anyone, run a free scan on their domain.** If you find anything — even domain variations that might be suspicious — lead with that.

**Subject:** Found 4 domains impersonating [their company] — wanted you to know

**Body:**
> Hi [Name],
>
> This might seem random, but I ran your domain through my brand protection tool and found:
>
> - [variation-1].com — registered, hosting active
> - [variation-2].net — MX records configured (possible email phishing)
> - [variation-3].com — similar visual layout to your site
>
> Might be nothing. Might be worth investigating.
>
> I built DoppelDown specifically to catch this early. Happy to give you a free account.
>
> [link]
>
> Richard

**Why this works:** Immediate, specific, free value. You're not asking for anything. The product demo is built into the outreach.

### Outbound Segmentation

| Segment | Volume | Approach | Expected Response Rate |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Tier 1: Warm network (Richard knows them) | 20-30 contacts | Phone/voice message | 40-60% |
| Tier 2: Warm-ish (1 degree away) | 50-100 contacts | LinkedIn DM + "Found something" email | 15-25% |
| Tier 3: Cold (Australian SMBs) | 200+/month | Cold email with free scan results | 3-8% |
| Tier 4: Cold (MSPs/MSSPs) | 50+/month | Cold email + partner pitch | 5-10% |

### CRM & Pipeline Tracking

Until DoppelDown has enough volume for a real CRM, track outbound in a simple spreadsheet:

```
| Name | Company | Segment | Date Contacted | Method | Response | Signup? | Paid? | Notes |
```

Graduate to a CRM (HubSpot free, or Pipedrive) at 100+ tracked contacts.

## 18. Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Low initial traction** — First 10 customers take longer than expected | Medium | High | Pre-scan prospects before outreach (the "found something" approach). Offer extended free trials. Focus on warm network first. |
| **Competitor launches cheap tier** — An incumbent creates an SMB product | Low | High | Speed is DoppelDown's friend. They'd cannibalise their own revenue. Focus on community/brand that can't be replicated overnight. |
| **Scan quality issues** — False positives or missed threats undermine trust | Medium | High | Run extensive testing before public launch. Monitor first 50 customer scans personally. Create feedback loop for scan quality. |
| **Richard's time constraints** — Day job limits growth efforts | High | Medium | Prioritise the 30-min/day routine. Lean on Ernie for content and automated workflows. Focus on highest-leverage activities (MSP outreach, customer calls). |
| **Google algorithm change** — SEO traffic drops | Low | Medium | Diversify traffic sources. Don't bet everything on one keyword. Build email list and community as Google-independent channels. |
| **Stripe/Supabase dependency** — Critical vendor has an outage or pricing change | Low | Medium | Keep architecture portable. Document migration paths. Monitor vendor health. |
| **Churn exceeds expectations** — Customers cancel after 1-2 months | Medium | High | Build "sticky" features (weekly digest, team sharing, compliance reports). Create cancellation survey. Offer pause instead of cancel. Follow up with every churned customer. |
| **Burn-out** — Richard tries to do too much alongside day job | Medium | High | Keep the routine to 30 min/day. Celebrate milestones. Remember: this is a marathon, not a sprint. DoppelDown grows while Richard sleeps (automated scanning, SEO compounding). |

### Contingency Plans

**If MRR < $500 at Month 3:**
1. Review scan quality — are threats being found? If not, the product needs improvement before more marketing.
2. Double down on "found something" outreach — scan 100 more domains, email every business where threats are found.
3. Offer a "brand audit" service ($99 one-time) as a wedge product — lower commitment than a subscription.
4. Consider a more generous free tier to build the user base first.

**If MRR < $2,000 at Month 6:**
1. Pivot toward MSP channel exclusively — if direct SMB acquisition is slow, MSP partnerships scale faster.
2. Create a "done-for-you" tier where Richard manually reviews and reports threats (higher touch, higher price).
3. Explore integration partnerships (Shopify, WordPress plugins) for distribution.
4. Consider partnering with an established cybersecurity vendor as a white-label provider.

**If a competitor launches a cheap tier:**
1. Double down on community, content, and personal brand — trust can't be copied.
2. Accelerate feature development in areas competitors haven't covered (MSP tools, report quality).
3. Publicly welcome competition — "Great news for SMBs! Here's how we compare: [honest comparison]."
4. Consider aggressive pricing — temporarily offer $29/mo to accelerate acquisition.

## Appendix A: Quick Reference — Acquisition Playbook Summary

### The 5 Highest-Impact Actions (Do These First)

1. **Run free scans on 50 businesses Richard knows** → Send "found something" emails
2. **Publish "Brand Protection Pricing Comparison 2026"** → Capture the uncontested SEO keyword
3. **DM 20 MSPs on LinkedIn** → Plant seeds for the highest-LTV channel
4. **Launch on Product Hunt** → One-time burst of awareness + lasting SEO value
5. **Post 3x/week on LinkedIn** → Build personal brand as the "brand protection for SMBs" expert

### The Pitch in Different Lengths

**One sentence:**
> "DoppelDown is brand protection for $49/mo — the only tool with transparent pricing in a market where everyone charges $50K+/year."

**30 seconds:**
> "Every brand protection tool costs $15K–$250K/year and makes you talk to a sales rep. DoppelDown does the same AI-powered detection — phishing sites, fake domains, social impersonation — for $49 a month with a free tier. Sign up, add your brand, and see threats in 5 minutes. No sales call."

**2 minutes:**
> "If someone registers a domain that looks like your business and uses it to phish your customers, how would you know? Most businesses wouldn't — not until a customer complains.
>
> Enterprise companies pay $50K–$250K/year for tools that monitor this. Small businesses? They get told 'you're too small.'
>
> I built DoppelDown to fix that. Brand protection at $49–$249/mo with a free tier. Self-serve, no sales call, results in 5 minutes.
>
> We scan for domain squatting, phishing sites, social media impersonation, and email infrastructure abuse. AI-powered risk scoring tells you what's worth worrying about. And we're the only tool in the entire market with transparent pricing.
>
> Want to try it?"
