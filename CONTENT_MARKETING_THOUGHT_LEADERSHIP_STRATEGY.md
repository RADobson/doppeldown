## 1. Strategic Vision & Thesis

### The Content Opportunity

DoppelDown operates in one of the most content-starved markets in cybersecurity. Here's the reality:

| Dimension | Enterprise Brand Protection Market | DoppelDown's Opportunity |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Content for SMBs** | Virtually nonexistent | Own the entire narrative |
| **Pricing transparency** | Zero public content | Be THE pricing authority |
| **Educational content** | Written for CISOs, not founders | Speak to real humans |
| **Thought leadership** | Vendor whitepapers behind gates | Open, accessible, opinionated |
| **Founder voices** | Hidden behind corporate PR | Richard becomes the face |
| **Data & research** | Proprietary, paywalled | Publish it free, earn trust |

### The Thesis

> **DoppelDown will become the definitive voice of "brand protection for real businesses" by publishing more useful, more accessible, and more transparent content than every enterprise competitor combined — and doing it in a voice that founders, marketers, and MSPs actually want to read.**

This isn't content marketing in the traditional "blog posts for SEO" sense. It's a **media strategy** — DoppelDown becomes the publication of record for anyone who cares about brand protection but doesn't have a $50K annual budget or a security operations centre.

### Three Strategic Outcomes

1. **Authority** — When someone Googles anything about brand protection for small-to-mid-sized businesses, DoppelDown content is the answer. Every time.
2. **Trust** — Richard is recognised as the leading voice making brand protection accessible. His LinkedIn posts get shared. His research gets cited. Journalists call him.
3. **Pipeline** — Content is the top-of-funnel engine. 60%+ of paying customers will touch DoppelDown content before signing up by Month 12.

### What This Strategy Is NOT

- ❌ Not "publish 2 blog posts per week and hope for SEO traffic"
- ❌ Not "create gated whitepapers to capture leads"
- ❌ Not "corporate content marketing with stock photos and platitudes"
- ✅ This is a **thought leadership program** built around original perspectives, real data, a distinctive voice, and a media-first mindset

## 2. Thought Leadership Positioning

### DoppelDown's Thought Leadership Territory

Every thought leader needs a **territory** — a specific angle that they own and are known for. DoppelDown's territory is:

> **"The democratisation of brand protection"**

This means:
- **Pricing transparency** in a market that hides it
- **Accessibility** of enterprise-grade capabilities for businesses of every size
- **Education** that empowers, not gatekeeps
- **Honest analysis** of an industry built on opacity and fear

### The Five Core Beliefs (Content Manifesto)

These beliefs underpin every piece of content DoppelDown produces. They are the editorial compass.

#### Belief 1: "Brand protection is a right, not a luxury"
Every business — whether it's a $500K e-commerce store or a $50B enterprise — deserves to know if someone is impersonating them. The current market treats brand protection as a premium service for the wealthy. That's wrong.

#### Belief 2: "If you hide your pricing, you're part of the problem"
The brand protection industry's refusal to publish pricing isn't just annoying — it's a barrier that excludes the businesses most vulnerable to brand impersonation. Transparent pricing isn't a marketing tactic; it's an ethical position.

#### Belief 3: "Complexity is the enemy of security"
Enterprise tools are impressive. They're also inaccessible. If a business owner needs a six-month implementation and a dedicated security analyst to monitor their brand, the tool has failed. Security should be as simple as signing up.

#### Belief 4: "SMBs are the real phishing targets — they just don't know it"
The media covers enterprise breaches. The data shows small businesses are disproportionately targeted. This gap between reality and awareness is where the most damage happens.

#### Belief 5: "The best defence is knowing you're being attacked"
Most brand impersonation succeeds because the victim never finds out — or finds out too late. Visibility is the first and most important layer of defence.

### Thought Leadership Positioning Matrix

| Audience | What They Need to Believe | Key Message | Content Vehicle |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| SMB Owners | "This is a real risk for my business, and I can afford to address it" | "Brand protection isn't just for the big guys" | Blog posts, LinkedIn content, case studies |
| MSPs/MSSPs | "I can offer this profitably to my clients" | "Brand protection is the next managed service" | Webinars, partner guides, ROI calculators |
| Brand/Marketing Managers | "I can protect the brand without enterprise budget" | "Board-ready protection at startup-friendly prices" | Reports, templates, comparison content |
| CTOs/Technical Founders | "This is a serious tool, not a toy" | "Enterprise-grade detection, modern delivery" | Technical deep-dives, API docs, architecture posts |
| Cybersecurity Community | "Richard knows what he's talking about" | "Insider perspective on an industry that needs disruption" | Conference talks, research, LinkedIn commentary |
| Media & Analysts | "DoppelDown is the interesting story in this space" | "The first self-serve brand protection platform" | Press releases, data studies, trend analysis |

---

## 3. Editorial Voice & Brand Narrative

### The DoppelDown Voice

DoppelDown's content voice is a carefully crafted combination of:

| Trait | What It Sounds Like | What It Doesn't Sound Like |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Plain-spoken** | "Someone registered a domain that looks like yours. Here's what to do." | "Leverage our comprehensive brand monitoring solution to mitigate digital risks." |
| **Confident** | "We checked 9 competitors. Not one publishes pricing. That's absurd." | "We believe our pricing may compare favourably to some alternatives." |
| **Empathetic** | "We know this is scary. Most businesses don't even know they're being targeted." | "Brand impersonation causes significant financial losses annually." |
| **Practical** | "Here are 5 things you can do right now, for free." | "Contact our sales team to learn about our comprehensive solutions." |
| **Irreverent** | "Your competitors charge $50K/year for this. We don't. You're welcome." | "We offer competitive pricing in the brand protection space." |
| **Transparent** | "Our detection isn't perfect yet. Here's what we're working on." | "Our industry-leading AI provides comprehensive coverage." |

### Voice Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use "you" and "your business" — make it personal
- Use specific numbers, not vague claims ("found 312 suspicious domains" not "found many threats")
- Name competitors by name in comparisons — don't be coy
- Admit limitations honestly — it builds trust faster than perfection claims
- Use Australian English spelling (colour, defence, organisation) in all content
- Write at a Year 10 reading level — the CEO of a small e-commerce business, not a CISO

**Don't:**
- Use jargon without explaining it ("APT," "IOC," "MITRE ATT&CK" — unless in technical content)
- Use fear-mongering language ("you WILL be attacked" → "here's what the data says")
- Use passive voice ("threats were detected" → "we found 6 suspicious domains")
- Use corporate platitudes ("industry-leading," "best-in-class," "holistic solution")
- Gate content behind forms — publish everything freely

### The Brand Narrative Arc

DoppelDown's story has a clear protagonist, antagonist, and resolution:

```
PROTAGONIST: Small and mid-sized businesses trying to protect their brand
     ↓
ANTAGONIST: An enterprise-only industry that excludes them +
            Increasingly sophisticated brand impersonation attacks
     ↓
GUIDE: Richard (cybersecurity insider who saw the gap) + DoppelDown (the tool)
     ↓
RESOLUTION: Enterprise-grade brand protection, accessible to everyone
```

This "StoryBrand" framework should be visible in every piece of content:
- **The customer is the hero** (not DoppelDown)
- **Richard/DoppelDown is the guide** (the expert who helps the hero succeed)
- **The villain is the status quo** (opaque pricing, inaccessible tools, unaddressed threats)

---

## 5. Thought Leadership Content Programs

### Program 1: "The Transparency Report" (Quarterly)

**Concept:** A quarterly publication that breaks down the brand protection industry with original data, pricing analysis, and market commentary. Think of it as DoppelDown's equivalent of a "State of the Industry" report — but actually useful and not paywalled.

**Frequency:** Quarterly (January, April, July, October)
**Format:** Long-form blog post + downloadable PDF + LinkedIn article + social thread
**Length:** 3,000-5,000 words with charts, tables, and original data

**Each edition covers:**
1. **Pricing watch** — Updated pricing comparison across all competitors (using public data, estimates, and any new intel)
2. **Threat landscape** — Aggregate data from DoppelDown scans (anonymised): types of threats found, trending tactics, regional patterns
3. **Industry moves** — Competitor acquisitions, new entrants, funding rounds, product launches
4. **SMB spotlight** — Real stories (anonymised) of how brand impersonation affected small businesses
5. **Richard's take** — 500-word editorial on one key trend or market shift

**Why this works:**
- Creates a **recurring content event** that people anticipate
- Generates **backlinks** (journalists and bloggers cite industry reports)
- Builds **proprietary data advantage** (no one else has aggregated SMB brand threat data)
- Positions DoppelDown as the **market analyst**, not just a vendor

**First edition title:** *"The Transparency Report, Q1 2026: What 1,000 Brand Scans Revealed About SMB Phishing Threats"*

---

### Program 2: "Brand Under Siege" (Monthly Case Study Series)

**Concept:** A monthly deep-dive into a real (anonymised) brand impersonation incident — how it was discovered, the attack anatomy, the impact, and how it was resolved. Think "Darknet Diaries" but for brand protection.

**Frequency:** Monthly
**Format:** Blog post (2,000-3,000 words) + LinkedIn narrative post + potential podcast episode
**Structure:**

```
Part 1: The Discovery — "A customer sent us a link to a website that looked exactly like ours..."
Part 2: The Investigation — "Here's what we found when we dug in..."
Part 3: The Attack Anatomy — Technical breakdown of how it was set up
Part 4: The Response — What the business did (and what they should have done)
Part 5: The Lesson — What every business can learn from this
Part 6: Prevention Checklist — Specific actions to avoid this
```

**Source material:**
- DoppelDown scan results (anonymised)
- Public breach/phishing reports
- Richard's professional experience
- Customer stories (with permission)
- Reconstructions of known attacks from news reports

**Why this works:**
- **Narrative content** is the most shareable and engaging format
- Creates **emotional connection** to the problem (not just statistics)
- Demonstrates **product capability** without being a product pitch
- Builds a **content library** that compounds over time
- Can be **pitched to media** as expert analysis

**First edition:** *"Brand Under Siege #1: How a Sunshine Coast Bakery Found 6 Fake Websites Selling 'Their' Cakes"*

---

### Program 3: "The DoppelDown Index" (Monthly Threat Data)

**Concept:** A monthly one-page data snapshot showing brand impersonation trends, aggregated from DoppelDown's scan data. Simple, visual, shareable.

**Frequency:** Monthly (1st week of each month covering prior month)
**Format:** Infographic + blog post + LinkedIn image post + email to subscribers

**Data points included:**
1. Total domains scanned / threats detected (ratio)
2. Top threat types this month (typosquatting, homoglyph, social media, email)
3. Most targeted industries
4. Geographic hotspots (where are the threats hosted?)
5. Average threats per brand scanned
6. New TLD registrations targeting known brands
7. Month-over-month trend arrow

**Example:**

```

│                                                          │
│  💡 "Homoglyph attacks increased 23% this month,         │
│     suggesting automated tooling is getting more          │
│     sophisticated." — Richard, DoppelDown                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this works:**
- **Monthly cadence** creates expectation and habit
- **Visual/infographic** format is the most shareable on LinkedIn
- **Proprietary data** that no one else has — this is ours to own
- **Media pickup** — journalists love data snapshots for articles
- **Low production cost** — automated data pull + template design

---

### Program 4: "Ask a Brand Protection Expert" (Weekly Q&A)

**Concept:** Richard answers one real question per week from a customer, prospect, or community member. Published as a short-form blog post and LinkedIn post.

**Frequency:** Weekly (every Wednesday)
**Format:** 500-800 word blog post + LinkedIn post + included in weekly email digest
**Structure:**

```
THE QUESTION: [Verbatim question from a real person]
THE SHORT ANSWER: [2-3 sentence direct answer]
THE FULL ANSWER: [500-600 words with context, nuance, and practical advice]
THE ACTION STEP: [One specific thing the reader can do right now]
```

**Question sources:**
- Customer support emails
- Reddit/Quora/HN comments
- LinkedIn DMs
- Google Search "People Also Ask" data
- Industry events / webinars

**Example questions:**
- "Is brand protection worth it for a business with only $300K revenue?"
- "Can someone actually register a domain that looks identical to mine?"
- "What's the first thing I should do if I find a fake website using my brand?"
- "How do phishing takedowns actually work? Who takes the site down?"
- "I'm an MSP — how do I sell brand protection to clients who think they're 'too small'?"

**Why this works:**
- **Real questions = real SEO** — these are the long-tail queries people actually type
- **Builds community** — people feel heard when their question gets a public expert answer
- **Low effort, high value** — Richard already knows the answers; just need to format them
- **Positions Richard as the expert** people think of first
- **Content source for social** — each Q&A is a natural LinkedIn post

---

### Program 5: "The Brand Protection Bulletin" (Biweekly Email Newsletter)

**Concept:** A curated email newsletter covering brand protection news, DoppelDown product updates, content highlights, and one "Richard's take" commentary. The goal is to become the one email people actually open about brand protection.

**Frequency:** Every 2 weeks (Tuesday morning, AEST)
**Format:** Email (plain-text with minimal HTML styling — feels personal, not corporate)
**Length:** 5-7 minutes read time

**Structure:**

```
Subject Line: [Catchy, not clickbait — e.g., "4 new phishing campaigns, 1 pricing rant, and a takedown template"]

1. 👋 One-paragraph personal intro from Richard (conversational)

2. 🔍 Threat Watch (2-3 bullet points)
   - News about brand impersonation, phishing campaigns, new attack techniques
   - Links to external sources + DoppelDown commentary

3. 📝 From the Blog (1-2 new posts)
   - Title + 2-sentence summary + link
   - Why it matters

4. 💡 Richard's Take (1 paragraph)
   - An opinionated observation about the industry
   - This is the section people will quote and share

5. 🛠️ Tool/Resource of the Week
   - One free tool, template, or resource (DoppelDown or third-party)
   - Genuine recommendation, not always DoppelDown product

6. 📊 DoppelDown Index Highlight (1 data point)
   - "This month we scanned X brands and found Y threats. The most common..."

7. 🤝 Community Spotlight
   - Shout out a customer, partner, or community member
   - Or highlight a great question from "Ask an Expert"

[Footer: Unsubscribe, social links, website]
```

**Why this works:**
- **Direct relationship with audience** — email is owned media, not rented (unlike social)
- **Thought leadership delivery vehicle** — "Richard's Take" is the anchor section
- **Compounds over time** — email list is a permanent asset
- **Drives return traffic** to blog and product
- **Newsletter sponsorship potential** (Month 12+ revenue opportunity)

**Subscriber growth strategy:**
- Blog CTA: "Get the Brand Protection Bulletin" (not "subscribe to our newsletter")
- Free tier onboarding email: invite to join
- LinkedIn post CTA: "I break down this stuff every 2 weeks in the Bulletin — link in comments"
- Partner co-sends: MSPs forward to their client lists

**Target subscribers:** 500 by Month 6, 2,000 by Month 12

## 6. Content Formats & the Media Mix

### Format Strategy: Right Content, Right Format, Right Channel

Not every idea should be a blog post. Content format should match the idea, the audience, and the channel where it'll perform best.

### Format Portfolio

| Format | Purpose | Effort | Frequency | Primary Channel |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Long-form blog** (2,000-5,000 words) | SEO, authority, education | High | 2/week (Month 1-3), 1/week (Month 4+) | DoppelDown blog |
| **Short-form blog** (500-1,000 words) | Q&A, news commentary, quick guides | Low | 1/week | DoppelDown blog |
| **LinkedIn post** (150-300 words) | Thought leadership, engagement | Low | 3-5/week | LinkedIn |
| **LinkedIn article** (1,000-2,000 words) | Repurposed blog content, native reach | Medium | 1/week | LinkedIn |
| **Email newsletter** | Direct engagement, nurture | Medium | Biweekly | Email |
| **Infographic** | Data visualisation, social sharing | Medium | Monthly | LinkedIn, blog, email |
| **Video (Loom-style)** | Product demos, walkthroughs, tips | Low-Medium | 2/month | YouTube, LinkedIn, blog |
| **Video (talking head)** | Commentary, reactions, Q&A | Low | 1-2/week (LinkedIn) | LinkedIn, YouTube |

| **Downloadable PDF** | Checklists, templates, reports | Medium | Monthly | Blog (ungated), email |
| **Social media thread** | Bite-sized education, stories | Low | 2-3/week | LinkedIn, X |
| **Webinar** | Partner enablement, product demos | High | Monthly (Phase 2+) | Zoom/YouTube Live |

### The Content Pyramid

```

**The principle:** Create one high-quality piece of flagship or pillar content, then extract 5-10 derivative pieces from it. Never create content in isolation.

### Content Atomisation Framework

For every major content piece, extract the following derivatives:

```
ORIGINAL: "Brand Protection Pricing: What Every Option Actually Costs in 2026"
(3,000-word blog post with comparison tables and analysis)

DERIVATIVE 1: LinkedIn article (repurpose full text, native to LinkedIn)
DERIVATIVE 2: LinkedIn post — "I checked 9 brand protection vendors. Not one publishes pricing. Here's what they actually charge..." (key insight as hook)
DERIVATIVE 3: LinkedIn carousel — "Brand Protection Pricing Comparison 2026" (visual slides)
DERIVATIVE 4: X/Twitter thread — 8 tweets breaking down the pricing landscape
DERIVATIVE 5: Email newsletter feature — "This week's blog: the pricing post everyone's been asking for"
DERIVATIVE 6: Infographic — pricing comparison table as a shareable image
DERIVATIVE 7: Reddit post — "I analysed the brand protection market — here's what they actually charge" (value-first, link if asked)

## 7. Original Research & Data-Driven Content

### Why Original Research Is DoppelDown's Secret Weapon

DoppelDown has something no blog post, no guest article, and no competitor comparison can replicate: **real scan data from real businesses.** This data, aggregated and anonymised, becomes the foundation of a content moat that earns links, media attention, and analyst recognition.

### Research Program 1: "The Australian Brand Threat Report"

**Timeline:** Launch Month 3 (requires sufficient scan data)
**Format:** 5,000+ word report + downloadable PDF + blog summary + press release
**Update cadence:** Annually (H1 and H2 reports)

**Methodology:**
1. Scan 100+ Australian brand domains across 10 industries
2. Record: threats found, types, registrar patterns, hosting locations, risk scores
3. Anonymise all data (no individual brand results published without permission)
4. Analyse patterns by industry, company size, domain age, TLD usage

**Key findings to pursue:**
- Average number of impersonation domains per Australian brand
- Most impersonated industries
- Percentage of brands with at least one active phishing domain
- Where threats are hosted (country distribution)
- Correlation between brand visibility and threat volume
- Gap between threat volume and awareness ("X% of businesses had no idea")

**Distribution plan:**
1. Publish full report on blog (ungated — no email wall)
2. PDF version available for download (optional email capture)
3. Submit to Australian cybersecurity media (IT News AU, CSO Australia, Startup Daily)
4. Send to Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) — position as "citizen research"
5. LinkedIn campaign: 5-post series extracting key findings over 2 weeks
6. Pitch to journalists covering cybersecurity, small business, or Australian tech
7. Submit as data source to analysts (Gartner, Forrester) who cover brand protection

**Expected outcomes:**
- 10-20 high-quality backlinks from media coverage
- 2-3 media interviews or quotes
- Significant social sharing (data-driven content outperforms opinion 3:1)
- Establishes DoppelDown as a primary data source in brand protection

### Research Program 2: "The SMB Brand Protection Survey"

**Timeline:** Month 6
**Format:** Survey of 200-500 small business owners + report

**Survey design (8-10 questions):**
1. Has your business ever experienced brand impersonation? (Y/N/Unsure)
2. What type? (Domain squatting / Fake website / Fake social media / Email spoofing / Other)
3. How did you find out? (Customer complaint / Google search / Social media / Brand monitoring tool / Never found out, just suspect)
4. What action did you take? (Reported to platform / Hired legal / Used a monitoring tool / Did nothing / Didn't know what to do)
5. Have you ever paid for brand protection? (Y/N)
6. If no, why not? (Too expensive / Didn't know it existed / Don't think we need it / Don't know how)
7. What would you pay monthly for brand monitoring? ($0 / $25-50 / $50-100 / $100-250 / $250+)
8. How would you rate your awareness of brand impersonation risks? (1-5)

**Distribution:** LinkedIn polls, email to subscribers, Reddit surveys, SurveyMonkey Audience (paid panel if budget allows, ~$500-1000)

**Report title:** *"The State of SMB Brand Protection 2026: What 500 Business Owners Told Us"*

### Research Program 3: Ongoing Data Publishing

**Monthly data publications (from "The DoppelDown Index"):**
- Total threats detected across all users (cumulative counter)
- Average threats per brand by industry
- Trending TLDs used in impersonation domains
- Fastest-growing threat type month-over-month

**Ad-hoc data publications (timely, newsworthy):**
- When a major phishing campaign hits the news: "We scanned 50 brands in [affected sector] — here's what we found"
- When a new TLD launches: "3 days after .xyz launched, here's how many squatted domains we detected"
- When regulatory changes happen: "ACSC's new guidelines recommend brand monitoring — here's the current state of play"

## 8. Richard's Personal Brand Strategy

### Why Personal Brand > Company Brand (For Now)

In the early stage, Richard's personal credibility is more valuable than DoppelDown's brand. People buy from people they trust, especially in cybersecurity. The strategy is to build Richard's authority, then transfer that trust to DoppelDown as the company grows.

### Richard's Positioning

> **Richard Dobson** — *Cybersecurity professional building DoppelDown to make brand protection accessible to every business, not just the Fortune 500.*

**Key credentials to lean on:**
- Years in cybersecurity sales engineering (technical credibility)
- Experience with enterprise security tools (CrowdStrike, Proofpoint, Netskope)
- Hands-on experience seeing the gap between enterprise capabilities and SMB needs
- Building DoppelDown as a founder/engineer (skin in the game)

### LinkedIn Personal Brand Program

LinkedIn is the #1 platform for Richard's thought leadership. The strategy is methodical.

#### Profile Optimisation

| Element | Current State | Optimised |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Headline** | (Needs update) | `Cybersecurity SE → Building DoppelDown: Brand protection for $49/mo, not $50K/yr` |
| **Banner** | (Needs update) | Custom banner: "Brand protection for the rest of us — doppeldown.com" |
| **About** | (Needs update) | 3-paragraph story: career context → the problem → DoppelDown mission |
| **Featured** | Empty | Pin: pricing comparison post, best blog post, DoppelDown launch post |
| **Experience** | Current | Add "Founder, DoppelDown" with compelling description |

#### Content Cadence & Themes

**Weekly posting schedule (5 posts/week):**

| Day | Theme | Format | Example |
|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| **Monday** | 📊 Data / Insight | Text + image/chart | "We scanned 50 e-commerce brands this week. 78% had at least one suspicious domain registered." |
| **Tuesday** | 🧠 Industry Commentary | Text (300-500 words) | "Another $200M brand protection vendor just raised money. Still no self-serve option. Here's what that tells us..." |
| **Wednesday** | ❓ Expert Q&A | Text (200-400 words) | "Someone asked me: 'Is brand protection worth it for a 5-person business?' Here's my honest answer..." |
| **Thursday** | 🔨 Builder Story | Text (300-500 words) | "Week 8 of building DoppelDown. This week I learned why enterprise security vendors can't serve SMBs..." |
| **Friday** | 💡 Practical Tip | Text + carousel/image | "3 free things you can do right now to check if someone is impersonating your brand: [steps]" |

#### Engagement Protocol (15 min/day)

**Morning routine (10 minutes):**
1. Check notifications — respond to all comments on own posts
2. Comment on 3-5 posts from: cybersecurity professionals, MSP owners, Australian business leaders
3. Comments must add value (not "great post!" — provide an insight, share data, ask a question)

**Afternoon routine (5 minutes):**
1. Respond to any DMs
2. Comment on 2-3 more relevant posts
3. Send 1-2 connection requests to people who engaged with DoppelDown-related content

## 9. Content Distribution Engine

### The Distribution Matrix

Content creation without distribution is a waste. Every piece of content has a distribution plan mapped before it's written.

### Channel-by-Channel Distribution Playbook

#### LinkedIn (Primary Social Channel)

| Content Type | LinkedIn Format | Timing | Frequency |
|-------------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| New blog post | Text post with key insight + link in comments | Same day as publish | With every blog post |
| New blog post (long) | Full LinkedIn article (native) | 1-2 days after publish | Monthly (best posts only) |
| Data/research | Carousel (image slides) | Tuesday or Wednesday AM | Monthly |
| Expert Q&A | Text post (300-400 words) | Wednesday | Weekly |
| Industry commentary | Text post (200-400 words) | Varies | 2-3x/week |
| Product updates | Text post with screenshot | Thursday | As needed |
| Partner content | Text post tagging partners | Varies | As available |

**LinkedIn algorithm tips:**
- Posts without links get 2-3x more reach → put links in first comment
- Dwell time matters → write content that takes 30+ seconds to read
- Questions drive engagement → end posts with a question
- Engagement in first 60 minutes determines reach → notify 5-10 people to comment early
- Native documents (PDF uploads) get exceptional reach

#### Reddit (Community Distribution)

| Subreddit | Appropriate Content | Frequency | Rules |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| r/cybersecurity | Educational, technical, data-driven | Bi-weekly max | Never pitch. Only link if directly relevant or asked. |
| r/smallbusiness | Practical guides, founder stories, free tools | Bi-weekly max | "I built this" format works. Be genuine. |
| r/msp | MSP-focused content, partner discussions | Monthly | Ask for feedback, offer free trials. |
| r/sysadmin | Technical detection content | Monthly | Very technical audience. Respect the norms. |
| r/SaaS | Business building content | Bi-weekly | Share metrics, lessons learned. |
| r/Entrepreneur | Founder journey, bootstrapping | Monthly | Vulnerability and transparency work best. |

#### Email (Direct Distribution)

Every piece of content is distributed to the email list through:
- Biweekly newsletter (primary vehicle)
- Dedicated sends for major content (quarterly reports, data studies)
- Onboarding drip sequence (5-email series featuring best content)
- Re-engagement emails (dormant subscribers get "best of" roundup)

#### Content Syndication (Earned/Borrowed Distribution)

| Platform | What to Syndicate | Canonical Strategy |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Medium | Repub best blog posts | Set canonical URL → DoppelDown blog |
| Dev.to | Technical posts only | Set canonical URL → DoppelDown blog |
| Hacker Noon | Industry analysis posts | Canonical + excerpt → full article on blog |
| LinkedIn articles | Best-performing blog posts | Canonical URL in footer |
| Industry publications | Guest-contributed versions | Varies — negotiate canonical |

**Important:** Always set canonical URLs to DoppelDown.com to preserve SEO value.

### The 48-Hour Distribution Sprint

Every major content piece (1,500+ words) gets this treatment within 48 hours of publication:

```
HOUR 0: Publish on DoppelDown blog
HOUR 1: LinkedIn text post (key insight hook + link in comment)
HOUR 2: Email to subscriber list (or queue for next newsletter)
HOUR 4: Identify 2-3 relevant Reddit/Quora threads → provide value + link if appropriate
HOUR 8: Submit to relevant content aggregators (GrowthHackers, Lobsters, etc.)
HOUR 24: LinkedIn article (full repub for extended reach)
HOUR 24: X/Twitter thread (5-8 tweets breaking down key points)
HOUR 36: Identify 3-5 people who would find this valuable → DM them the link
HOUR 48: Community posts (Reddit, HN if appropriate for content type)
```

## 10. Community Building & Engagement

### Community Strategy Overview

DoppelDown's community strategy is about **embedding in existing communities**, not building one from scratch (yet). The goal: become a known, trusted, helpful presence in every community where DoppelDown's target audiences already gather.

### Community Presence Map

```

### Engagement Cadence

| Activity | Frequency | Time Investment | Priority |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| LinkedIn post creation | 5x/week | 30 min/day | 🔴 Critical |
| LinkedIn comment engagement | Daily | 15 min/day | 🔴 Critical |
| Reddit value-add comments | 3-5x/week | 15 min/session | 🟡 High |
| Reddit original posts | 1-2x/week | 30 min each | 🟡 High |
| Quora answers | 2-3x/week | 15 min each | 🟡 Medium |
| HN engagement | 1-2x/week | 15 min each | 🟡 Medium |
| X/Twitter posts | 3-5x/week | 10 min/day | 🟢 Medium |
| IH updates | 1x/week | 20 min | 🟢 Low |
| Industry forum participation | 1-2x/week | 15 min | 🟢 Low |

### Community Content Calendar (Weekly Rhythm)

| Day | Community Focus | Time |
|-----|----------------|------|
| Monday | LinkedIn post + 5 engagement comments. Reddit: scan relevant threads. | 30 min |
| Tuesday | LinkedIn post + email newsletter (biweekly). Quora: 2 answers. | 30 min |
| Wednesday | LinkedIn Q&A post. Reddit: original post (rotating subreddits). | 30 min |
| Thursday | LinkedIn builder story. HN engagement. | 30 min |
| Friday | LinkedIn tip post. IH update. Weekly community review. | 30 min |

### Building Toward an Owned Community (Month 12+)

Once DoppelDown has 100+ active users and 2,000+ newsletter subscribers, consider:

1. **DoppelDown Community Slack/Discord** — Private channel for customers + partners
   - #general, #threats-spotted, #feature-requests, #partner-chat
   - Weekly "threat of the week" discussion thread
   - Richard does a monthly AMA

2. **DoppelDown Forum** — Public forum for brand protection discussions
   - Becomes an SEO asset (user-generated content)
   - Moderated by DoppelDown team
   - "Verified expert" badges for active community members

3. **DoppelDown Champions Program** — Reward most active users
   - Free plan upgrades for community contributors
   - Early access to new features
   - Featured in case studies and newsletter

**Not now.** Don't build owned community infrastructure until there are enough people to sustain it. A dead Discord server is worse than no Discord server.

## 11. Email Marketing & Nurture Sequences

### Email Strategy Overview

Email is DoppelDown's most valuable owned channel. Unlike social media, the algorithm can't deprioritise you. Unlike search, competitors can't outrank you. An email subscriber is a direct relationship.

### Email List Segmentation

| Segment | Definition | Content Focus |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Free users (no scan)** | Signed up but never ran a scan | "Here's what to expect" + onboarding nudges |
| **Free users (active)** | Ran at least 1 scan, no upgrade | "Here's what you're missing" + upgrade triggers |
| **Paid subscribers** | Active paying customers | Product tips, advanced guides, feature updates |
| **Churned** | Cancelled subscription | Win-back content, "what's new" updates |
| **Newsletter only** | Subscribed to newsletter, no account | Educational content, low-pressure CTAs |
| **MSP/Partner** | Identified as MSP or agency | Partner-specific content, MSP enablement |

### Sequence 1: Onboarding Drip (New Free User)

**Trigger:** Signup for free account
**Goal:** Get them to run their first scan → see threats → consider upgrading
**Emails:** 5 emails over 14 days

| # | Day | Subject Line | Content |
|---|-----|-------------|---------|
| 1 | 0 | "Welcome to DoppelDown — here's your first scan in 2 minutes" | Quick-start guide. Direct CTA to add brand and scan. |
| 2 | 2 | "Did you know? The average brand has 5.8 impersonation domains" | Data-driven nudge. Link to "brand impersonation statistics" blog post. |
| 3 | 5 | "What [Scan Status] means for your brand" | Personalised: if they scanned, reference results. If not, highlight what they're missing. |
| 4 | 9 | "3 things the free tier can't do (and why they matter)" | Honest comparison of free vs. paid. No hard sell — just clarity. |
| 5 | 14 | "A quick question from Richard" | Personal email from Richard asking for feedback. One question: "What would make DoppelDown more useful for you?" |

### Sequence 2: Upgrade Trigger (Active Free User with Threats Found)

**Trigger:** Free user scan detected 3+ threats
**Goal:** Convert to paid
**Emails:** 3 emails over 7 days

| # | Day | Subject Line | Content |
|---|-----|-------------|---------|
| 1 | 0 | "We found [X] threats targeting [brand name] — here's what to do" | Summary of threats found. Explain what free tier monitors vs. what paid monitors. |
| 2 | 3 | "What happens when a phishing domain goes from 'suspicious' to 'active'?" | Education on threat progression. Paid tier = real-time monitoring vs. weekly. |
| 3 | 7 | "Your brand scan: what's changed since last week?" | Show new findings (if any). Remind that continuous monitoring catches threats at registration, not just when they go live. |

### Sequence 3: Win-Back (Churned Customers)

**Trigger:** Subscription cancelled (after 30-day grace period)
**Goal:** Re-engage with new features or content
**Emails:** 2 emails over 60 days

| # | Day | Subject Line | Content |
|---|-----|-------------|---------|
| 1 | 30 | "We've been busy since you left — here's what's new" | Feature updates, new content, any improvements to their specific pain point. |
| 2 | 60 | "Quick thought: is [their brand] still being monitored?" | Gentle reminder that threats don't stop. Offer a free 30-day trial to come back. |

### Newsletter: "The Brand Protection Bulletin"

(Detailed in Program 5 above. Email infrastructure specifics below.)

**Tech stack recommendations:**
- **Month 1-3:** Resend (free tier up to 3,000 emails/month, great developer experience)
- **Month 3-6:** Migrate to ConvertKit or Beehiiv if newsletter becomes primary growth channel
- **Month 6+:** Consider Loops for product-led email automation at scale

**Key email metrics to track:**

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Open rate | >35% | Below 25% = subject lines or deliverability issue |
| Click rate | >5% | Below 3% = content not compelling |
| Unsubscribe rate | <0.5% per send | Above 1% = too frequent or wrong audience |
| Reply rate | >1% | Replies = engaged audience + deliverability boost |
| Forward rate | Any | Forwards = your best word-of-mouth metric |

---

## 12. Strategic Partnerships & Co-Marketing

### Partnership Content Strategy

Partnerships multiply DoppelDown's reach by accessing other companies' audiences. The key: **create joint content that's genuinely useful to both audiences.**

## 13. Content Operations & Workflow

### Content Production Process

Every piece of content follows a 6-step process:

```
1. IDEATION → 2. BRIEF → 3. CREATION → 4. REVIEW → 5. PUBLISH → 6. DISTRIBUTE

     ↑                                                              │
     └──────────── 7. MEASURE → 8. OPTIMISE ───────────────────────┘
```

### Step 1: Ideation (Ongoing)

**Content idea sources (ranked by quality):**
1. Customer questions (support emails, chat, onboarding calls)
2. Search Console queries people are already finding us for
3. Competitor content gaps (what are they NOT covering?)
4. Industry news and events
5. Community discussions (Reddit, LinkedIn, forums)
6. Keyword research (SEO tools)
7. Personal experience and opinions
8. Partner suggestions

**Capture system:** Maintain a content idea backlog in a simple spreadsheet:

| Idea | Source | Pillar | Audience | Estimated Effort | Priority | Status |
|------|--------|--------|----------|-----------------|----------|--------|
| How to get a fake IG account removed | Customer question | Practical Guide | E-Commerce | Medium | High | Draft |
| Homoglyph attacks explained | SEO keyword gap | Education | General | Low | Medium | Backlog |

### Step 2: Content Brief

Before writing any piece >1,000 words, create a brief:

```markdown
## Content Brief

**Title:** [Working title]
**Target keyword:** [Primary keyword]
**Supporting keywords:** [3-5 secondary keywords]
**Pillar:** [Which of the 6 pillars]
**Audience:** [Primary persona]
**Funnel stage:** [Awareness / Consideration / Decision]
**Format:** [Blog / Guide / Report / etc.]
**Target length:** [Word count range]
**Competitive analysis:** [What currently ranks for this keyword? What's missing?]
**Unique angle:** [What makes DoppelDown's take different?]
**Internal links:** [Which existing pages should this link to?]
**CTA:** [What action should the reader take after reading?]
**Distribution plan:** [Where will this be shared?]
**Deadline:** [Date]
```

### Step 3-4: Creation & Review

**Content creation with AI assistance:**
- Ernie (AI assistant) can draft content based on briefs
- Richard reviews, adds personal insights, and ensures voice consistency
- All statistics and claims must be verified
- All competitor pricing must note "estimated" where exact figures aren't published

**Quality checklist (every piece):**
- [ ] Matches the content brief
- [ ] Voice is consistent with DoppelDown guidelines (Section 3)
- [ ] Contains internal links (2-3 minimum)
- [ ] Has clear CTA
- [ ] SEO elements complete (title, meta, headings, alt text)
- [ ] Factual accuracy verified
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
- [ ] Formatted for readability (short paragraphs, headers, bullet lists)

### Step 5-6: Publish & Distribute

- Publish on blog (scheduled if needed for optimal timing)
- Execute 48-hour distribution sprint (Section 9)
- Track distribution in content tracking spreadsheet

### Content Production Capacity

Realistic capacity assessment for a bootstrapped team (Richard + Ernie AI):

| Content Type | Time to Produce | Monthly Capacity |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Long-form blog post (2,000+ words) | 3-4 hours (AI draft + Richard review) | 6-8 |
| Short-form blog post (500-1,000 words) | 1-2 hours | 4-8 |
| LinkedIn post | 15-20 minutes | 20-25 |
| LinkedIn article (repurposed) | 30-45 minutes | 4 |
| Email newsletter | 1-2 hours | 2 |
| Infographic | 2-3 hours (with design tool) | 1-2 |
| Video (Loom walkthrough) | 30-60 minutes | 2-4 |
| Downloadable PDF | 2-4 hours | 1 |

**Total monthly content budget: ~40-50 hours (10-12 hours/week)**
This is manageable alongside Richard's day job if Ernie handles first drafts and Richard focuses on review, personalisation, and LinkedIn engagement.

### Content Tools Stack

| Purpose | Tool | Cost |
|---------|------|------|
| Blog CMS | Next.js (already built) | Free |
| Email marketing | Resend (start) → ConvertKit/Beehiiv (scale) | Free → $29/mo |
| Social scheduling | Buffer or Typefully | Free → $15/mo |
| Design (infographics) | Canva Pro | $13/mo |
| SEO monitoring | Google Search Console + Ubersuggest | Free + $29/mo |
| Content tracking | Google Sheets or Notion | Free |
| Video | Loom | Free tier |
| Analytics | Plausible or PostHog | Free → $9/mo |

**Total content stack cost: ~$50-100/month** — deliberately lean.

### Content Attribution Model

**Multi-touch attribution** — track content's role at multiple journey points:

First Touch:    What content did they FIRST engage with?
Last Touch:     What content was the LAST thing before signup?
Assist:         What content did they consume BETWEEN first and last touch?
```

**Implementation:**
1. UTM parameters on all content links (utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_content)
2. Track blog → signup path in analytics (page flow analysis)
3. Ask "How did you hear about us?" in onboarding (qualitative)
4. Track email → signup path through email platform UTMs

## 16. Risk Mitigation & Content Governance

### Content Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Competitor pricing claims challenged** | Medium | High | Always use "estimated" language. Cite sources. Include methodology notes. |
| **Customer data exposed in case studies** | Low | Critical | NEVER publish identifiable customer data without written permission. Default: fully anonymised. |
| **Content quality dilution (too much, too fast)** | Medium | Medium | Quality checklist for every piece. Better to publish 1 great post than 3 mediocre ones. |
| **Richard burnout** | Medium | High | Ernie handles drafts and distribution. Richard focuses on voice, opinions, and engagement. Cap at 12 hours/week. |
| **Competitor legal action over comparisons** | Low | Medium | Use factual, verifiable claims only. Link to sources. Include fair disclaimers. |
| **Google algorithm change impacts traffic** | Medium | Medium | Diversified distribution (not SEO-dependent). Email list as hedge. |
| **Content becomes stale** | Medium | Medium | Quarterly content audit. Update publish dates on refreshed content. |

### Editorial Guidelines

1. **Accuracy:** Every statistic must have a source. Every competitor claim must be verifiable.
2. **Fairness:** Competitor comparisons must acknowledge where competitors are genuinely better (e.g., "BrandShield offers managed takedowns — DoppelDown provides DIY tools and guidance").
3. **Privacy:** Never name a customer in content without explicit written permission. Never publish scan results that could identify a business.
4. **Disclaimers:** All pricing comparisons include: *"Competitor pricing is estimated based on publicly available information and may vary. Contact each vendor for current pricing."*
5. **Legal:** No claims about competitor security, reliability, or quality without evidence. Focus on pricing transparency and accessibility — these are structural facts, not opinions.

### Content Audit Schedule

| Frequency | Activity |
|-----------|---------|
| **Monthly** | Review top 10 posts by traffic. Check for outdated stats, broken links, stale CTAs. |
| **Quarterly** | Full content inventory review. Update or archive underperforming content. Refresh publish dates on updated posts. |
| **Annually** | Comprehensive content strategy review. Update all "2026" references. Refresh competitive pricing data. |

## Appendix C: Content Manifesto (Shareable Version)

*This shortened version can be published on the DoppelDown website as a "What We Believe" or "Our Content Philosophy" page.*

---

### The DoppelDown Content Promise

**We believe brand protection is a right, not a luxury.**

Every piece of content we publish follows these principles:

1. **No gatekeeping.** We don't hide useful information behind email forms, sales calls, or paywalls. If we know something that could help you protect your brand, we publish it freely.

2. **Plain language.** Cybersecurity is complex. Our explanations aren't. If your mum couldn't understand it, we haven't explained it well enough.

3. **Honest comparisons.** We name competitors, show pricing, and acknowledge when they're better at something. You deserve real information to make real decisions.

4. **Real data.** We cite our sources, show our methodology, and say "estimated" when we're estimating. No made-up statistics. No vague claims.

5. **Practical above all.** Every article ends with something you can actually do. We don't write to sound smart — we write to make you safer.

*This strategy is a living document. Review quarterly, update based on what's working, and don't be afraid to kill what isn't.*

*Document written: 2026-02-05*
*Next review: 2026-05-05*
